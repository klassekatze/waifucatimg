Third-party waifu lists are also allowed and may be found elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">The Company’s Waifus are all clones manufactured on demand. Waifus are sorted into eleven tiers, each of which has a different cost. See the table on the first page of </span><span class="c16">the spreadsheet</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;for details. “Capturing” a waifu in her homeworld adds that number of credits to your account. Capture credits are not granted for local versions of waifus you’ve purchased or alternate versions of waifus you’ve already captured once, unless they’re a higher-tiered variant. If you only wanted a capture for her credit value, you may ship her to the Company for the rest of her full purchase value; they’ll reprocess her and send her where she needs to go. Otherwise, captured waifus are yours to keep.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">Tier 11 waifus have no listed price and may not be purchased at any intensity below 11 without a special ticket. If you choose this instead, ignore the entire list of regular waifus. Instead, go to the Tier 11 list on the fifth page of </span><span class="c16">the spreadsheet</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;and spend your special ticket on one and only one of the waifus there. Some Tier 11 waifus are instead listed as Waifu Perks below; they may be chosen too. Heavenbuilt Proto and its AI, and Piece of Silver also count as Tier 11 waifus for this purpose. Captured Tier 11 waifus may be shipped back to the Company for an additional ticket, on top of the reward for capturing one in the first place. If you ever find yourself with a spare Tier 11 ticket and nobody you want to spend it on, you may exchange it for 2000 credits; this cannot be undone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The following non-waifu items are free in Intensity 11, if you want them: a single Binding-type control, all Lure-type controls, Psychic Paper, Sweet Home, Warranty Plan, all Talents and Defenses, and a 500 credit budget for Catch-a-Ride. If you wish, you may Possess your Tier 11 waifu, become an Extra, or Substitute into a target character of Tier 3 or lower. You may start in any world you like, regardless of the above intensity restrictions. If you start in your waifu’s homeworld, you may also take Yoink. All Tier 11 waifus have multiversal travel, including Heavenbuilt Proto, so go anywhere you want, follow the special rules, and have fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c23">Binding-type Controls:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">All bindings ensure a waifu's loyalty, friendship, and romantic and sexual interest in you, and nudge them in that direction toward your other waifus. Bonds between your waifus grow more quickly with increased interaction, but will not override familial relationships without significant pressure. Waifu obedience is not absolute. Waifus, in general, put the spirit of your orders over the letter. Strong-willed waifus may elect to ignore disliked orders and follow their own initiative; more often, a competent waifu whose moral alignment conflicts with an order’s means or ends will raise an objection and the two of you will have to argue it out. Bound waifus are also somewhat more likely, depending on their moral alignments, to consider “Just bind her and make her one of us” a valid solution to any problem involving a waifu candidate. Even the purest-hearted waifus can find themselves seduced by the power to turn any enemy into a friend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">For safety reasons, all purchased waifus are bound with one of the Stamp’s tattoos before delivery, unless you opt out of having any bindings. With one exception, noted in the binding’s description, you must apply all higher bindings to each waifu manually. When you buy a higher binding, the previous binds will disappear from existence; you’ll be refunded their full cost. The two exceptions to this are No Bindings, as there’s nothing to replace and refund, and the Stamp’s tattoos, which will merely become dormant (invisible and inert) while any higher binding is applied. If a waifu was never Stamped, whether by you or before delivery, the use of any higher binding method will also give her a dormant tattoo; this is what marks her as one of your captures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Binding or capturing any waifu whose powers come from an external, (semi-)sapient source will permanently sever their connection and replicate those powers as innate abilities. All waifus whose power comes with a crippling, categorical weakness, such as vampires, Kryptonians, or Devil Fruit users, will be no more affected by that weakness than an ordinary human. Both of these processes have already been applied to all purchased waifus, regardless of whether or not they’re bound.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">No matter which binding method you use (or don’t), you will receive a complimentary smart device of your choice, preloaded with the Company’s shopping app so you can manage your purchases and trade-ins on the go. You and your waifus are the only ones who can perceive or use any Company app, but only you can make any transactions through this one. This device cannot be hacked or destroyed. If this device is ever broken, it will repair itself completely the next time it isn’t observed. &nbsp;If this device is ever more than 10m away from you or any of your waifus for more than 15 minutes, it will teleport into your pocket. If the local space is too warped for that distance to be accurate, you may also recall it manually.

You do not need to bind your previously-purchased waifus immediately or pay off the whole debt at once, but you may not make any new purchases if you have negative credits. Capturing any waifu without bindings will award you the standard capture value of her original tier, before this option’s purchase discount.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Stamp (Default)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Type:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Binding</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Cost:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;0</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This permanent magical tattoo instills only the mental effects common to all bindings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">To capture waifus, you may apply this tattoo using a thumb-sized ink stamp that only you and your purchased and captured waifus can perceive. The most popular stamping sites are typically to the pubic region, lower back, or back of the neck. The inked part, on one end, contains the tattoo’s core, a circular design that serves as your emblem. Newly-applied tattoos require 72 hours to ramp up to their full effect. During that time, additional ink will fill itself in around your emblem to form a much more elaborate design, about the size of the waifu’s palm, that represents her history and personality. Captured waifus and people they know will not notice a tattoo-in-progress until it completes itself, at which point they’ll rationalize away its sudden appearance. Completed tattoos are always perceptible. If a tattoo’s location is ever damaged or severed, its effects will continue and it will reappear when the skin is regenerated or the body part replaced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The stamp never runs out of ink and cannot be used accidentally or on you. If one of your waifus marks a new girl with it, the new girl will feel its effects as if you had used it on her yourself. The anti-loss, -theft, and -destruction measures on the Company’s smart device also apply to this stamp.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A digital stamp app for your smart device is also available. Just take a photo of the target waifu, rotate, zoom, and pan around a generated 3D model of her until you’ve found the right place for your tattoo, and apply the tattoo remotely. This is a Company app and benefits from all such protections.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Tempest Choker</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Type:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Binding</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Cost:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;20</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Magitech jewelry that transforms its wearers into trophy wives over time. Transformation effects include increased stamina, slimmer waistlines, more expensive tastes in clothing and accessories, romantic and sexual interest in their master and other choker wearers in the same orbit (reduced by familial relations), inability to refuse any direct command by their master, and pronounced bust, hip, hair, and libido growth. Unlike the loyalty that other binding methods instill, the obedience enforced by these chokers is absolute, with no will-saves, intelligence-saves, or reinterpretations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">You receive one new choker each day, up to a limit of five in reserve. When a choker's latch is first closed around a wearer's neck, the latch disappears and manual removal becomes impossible - except if a choker is deactivated through the associated software, which will make the physical latch reappear. Active chokers are indestructible and may not otherwise be warped away. If a wearer dematerializes, or otherwise transforms away from a standard humanoid height and build, the choker will disappear with or into the wearer for the duration. Removal of a wearer's own choker becomes unthinkable after one full week (168 hours).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The chokers' software is installed as an app on your smart device. The app allows you to customize the degree of each primary and secondary effect, for each wearer. Your waifus cannot perceive the deactivation option. This is a Company app and benefits from all such protections.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">When a waifu first wears a choker, you may immediately shift her growth values along sliders from 0% to 100%. The standard growth presets are 0% for the belly slider and 100% for everything else. A wearer's prolonged resistance, or any tampering with the choker hardware, will raise any or all transformation limits beyond 100%, to a new maximum of up to 200%. (You can disable this for any/all waifus in the settings.) You may not manually set any waifu’s growth limits beyond what one waifu has achieved on her own. The progress of all of a wearer's effects surges when the wearer is highly aroused, especially in your presence or that of other wearers. The chokers' central gems visibly glow when this happens. If you have at least ten waifus and reached the 200% limit with at least one, an additional option will appear for the hair, breast, belly, and hip (ass) sliders: Continual. This adds 5% daily non-compounding growth to that trait, for that waifu, until you turn it off. Continual growth effects recede at 2% per day, again non-compounding.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">100% bust and hips represent the limits of natural growth in healthy humans, with each breast the size of the waifu’s head and each buttcheek the size of a volleyball. A 200% bust is large enough to hang past the navel even without notable sag; 200% hips are between two and three times wider than the shoulders, with each buttcheek the size of a medium yoga ball. 100% hair reaches down to the upper calves while worn loose and the woman is standing; 200% hair is twice that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">If the limit for a transformation effect is reduced to less than the actual progress of that transformation, the actual progress will recede to match. For this purpose, deactivating a choker is equivalent to setting all limits to 0%. If you trade in the Choker for a more advanced Binding, you can keep the smart device; the app will uninstall itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">If you (the Client) wear a choker, you’ll have full access to the physical and mental transformations, including a full suite of genderswap options: physical sex, mental identification, orientation, etc. Any self-applied, sufficiently-disabling mental transformation, such as bimbofication, will have an automatic time limit of 48 hours so you don’t get stuck. (If you return to that same transformation within 10 minutes, the time limit will be doubled each time until your streak ends. You may set a shorter limit if you like.) You’re your own master, so you may deactivate and remove your choker at any time and will not be subject to absolute obedience or any resistance clause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Chokers are available in ruby, orange topaz, citrine, emerald, sapphire, amethyst, alexandrite, and clear and black diamond varieties. Bracelet and anklet forms are also available.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c6 c24">Alterzelu Symbiote</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c27">Type:</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;Binding</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c27">Cost: </span><span class="c3">100</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">A set of black eggs appear scattered around your starting location or safehouse, one for each of your purchased waifus and each containing an alien symbiote. These symbiotes are guided by your mental commands and instinctively attack and merge with women in a sexual manner. They are perfectly concealed until they attack a waifu and cannot be fought off by any waifu below Tier 6. Your purchased waifus will all be stamped with the default tattoos until they’re made into hosts, except for one waifu whom you’ve designated as the Queen - her symbiote has already hatched from its egg and merged with her. In addition to their basic effects, the default binding tattoos will immediately prevent purchased waifus from lethally harming your symbiotes, though fully-bound waifus will usually accept the symbiote outright if they know you want them to. Unhosted symbiotes also emit a weak psychic field that reduces a target’s willingness to resist future attacks every time she fights one off. This reduction stacks indefinitely until she finally gives in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">When it attacks a waifu, a symbiote will latch onto her back, aligning its spine with hers, then penetrate her with its tail and engulf her head with its own. It then pumps a transformative fluid into her from both ends, merging their bodies together into a more idealized, sexual form. This initial transformation causes severe growth of the breasts, rear, and thighs, up to 100% on the Choker’s scale. This initial growth is not optional but may fully or partially reverse itself after the fact, depending on practical concerns and your personal preference. Symbiosis also alters the target’s mind, making her see you as either her mate or king, whose orders are to be obeyed and whose survival is paramount to the species, and induces an initial surge of lust that will only fade when satisfied by you. All symbiote-bound waifus will also see the Queen waifu as the first among them, regardless of previous relationships, and arrange themselves into a pyramidal hierarchy beneath her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">Alterzelu hosts can, at will, form an environmentally-sealed suit of bio-armor, with Xenomorph-like black chitin aesthetics, a retractable helmet, sharp claws, and a long tail for combat and maneuverability. You and all waifus benefit from Body Talent, Martial Talent, Wild Talent, Body Defense, and Wild Defense. (Take those five perks for free. If you already have some of these perks when you buy the Symbiote, you may claim a discount equal to the total value of the ones you had already purchased. If you trade in the Symbiote for another binding but want to keep those perks, their cost will be deducted from your refund.) Existing enchanted gear or otherwise super outfits, such as Life Fibers, power armor, or magical girl uniforms, will be integrated into this bio-armor. Hosts gain superhuman senses, strength, agility, and durability; this is enough to push any blue-star waifu up to Tier 4 or any copper-star waifu up one tier, but is not a significant gain for higher tiers. You may also take on an bio-armored form yourself, skipping the more invasive aspects of the merger. A telepathic network connects you to all Alterzelu hosts within your hive, even between different multiverses. This is not a hive mind, just voice chat and sense-sharing. Higher-ranked hosts in the hive’s hierarchy have more privilege in this network than lower-ranked hosts. As the person at the top of the hierarchy, you can demand access to the sensory feeds of anyone in the network and receive it without question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c28">The designated Queen can lay new Alterzelu eggs, after you’ve fertilized them, which will later hatch and convert further waifus in the traditional way. The Queen or any of her direct lieutenants may also convert a target in person by using the same transformative fluid from her mouth and tail. This trades speed and immediate effect for subtlety; a symbiote waifu can let her tail out without the rest of the armor, engage in yuri, and then leave before the real transformation begins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Shrouds of Power</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Type:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Binding</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Cost:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;200 (special)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">These semi-sapient capes of pure elemental magic can create constructs as well as any Lantern Ring. When used to cocoon and tentacle a waifu, they infuse her with your will, adding her to an empathic and telepathic group mind centered on yourself. Your waifu must submit to this bind beforehand, whether by persuasion, coercion (including Company Lures), or force. This group mind operates on two levels: the higher, active, level allows everyone connected to participate in a telepathic chatroom, even between different multiverses. The deeper, passive, level gives the shroud-bound a full awareness of your activity and needs, so they may even respond to orders that you haven't consciously given yet. Your ability to read shroud-bound minds is not so intuitive. This is only a group mind, not a hive mind. All shroud-bound retain their individuality within the network. Any morality shifts that shroud-bound may develop are simply the result of close mental proximity to, and enforced empathy for, people with vastly different backgrounds and life experiences than their own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A newly shroud-bound waifu’s clothes and makeup are absorbed into the cocoon and replaced with a new thematic style composed of solidified magic of the associated element. Existing enchanted gear or otherwise super outfits, such as Life Fibers, power armor, or magical girl uniforms, will be integrated into this elemental Cloak, as will any upgrades added after the fact. A shroud-bound waifu will always consider her Cloak her most comfortable outfit, but she may still dismiss it and wear normal outfits at any time. This power is an innate ability, granted by the Shroud, and does not require any magical talent. Additionally, shroud-bound waifus’ figures will slowly shift to fit your tastes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Shroud-bound find their capabilities significantly boosted. In addition to the effects of all purchased Talents that do not otherwise apply to your waifus, the magic itself grants noticeable buffs to waifus’ innate abilities and an affinity for the associated magical element. You also get the affinity; if you have Dragon Musk and a matching element, that bonus will also stack with the Shroud’s element. (Diminishing returns apply.) Shroud-bound may learn to make their own tendrils and constructs like your own; waifus who already practice mystical arts, and the associated magical element in particular, will have an easier time. Shroud-bound cannot capture new waifus using their tendrils - you must bind them yourself. Both you and your Shroud-bound may also form wings out of your Shroud or their Cloaks, for personal flight, and can instantly teleport to the location of anyone else in the group mind, even if the teleporter’s and destination’s Cloaks are both dismissed. All together, these buffs add up to an effective +3 ranks to blue-star waifus, +2 ranks to copper-star waifus, and +1 rank to silver-star waifus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Shrouds come in the following varieties.

"Elements" may be classical western (Earth, Fire, Wind/Air, Water, Aether), classical eastern (Metal, Wood, Void), chemical (Carbon, Mercury, Plutonium…), modern fantasy (Ice, Lightning, Poison…), or conceptual. Literally anything can be a conceptual element, provided you maintain a consistent theme, whether that’s Love, Time, Imagination, a season, Surprise, Heavy Metal, or even Infinity. If you have a Shroud that matches your dragon element, the two bonuses will stack. The more esoteric and exploitable your chosen element, the more time you’ll need to develop and master its full potential. This time starts at tens of years for the basics and can stretch into the millions of years for the truly exotic ideas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Your first alt-form is, effectively, full-coverage power armor or dragon-shaped mecha: biped, roughly 3 m tall, and maximizes your improved strength and protection at that size without sacrificing any finesse or maneuverability. Your second alt-form is a full-size dragon: quadruped with separate wings, 30 m tall at the shoulder (around 75 m from the nose to the base of the tail), and offers even more physical power with a massive buff to both your chosen affinity and all the other supernatural abilities you've acquired and trained.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The sizes of your two dragon forms are not set in stone: the more ki, psi, or magic power you have, the larger you can make them. This has no upper limit, but still requires significant time investments, longer than any mortal lifespan. Your mecha form can become large enough to wrestle Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann on an equal footing, and your dragon form can eventually swallow galaxies whole, but it’ll take you billions of years to get there. Before you think to use time magic to accelerate that process, first consider that more people would’ve done it if it were that easy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Your musk’s effects on uncaptured waifus scale with sustained proximity (closer is better), your physical exertion (sweat production, more is better), ventilation (less is better), and, most importantly, the waifu’s power as measured by her tier rating.

Waifus who share a theme with your draconic element get one &nbsp;You may also flare your musk at any time to add one effective tier to all waifus in the local universe for the duration.

If she stays within that range and never enters a closer one, she’ll be able to hold out for a few weeks before she succumbs to extreme sexual thirst of the “you” variety. For every closer radius she enters, the time she’ll be able to resist you will also decrease by one step. This measurement of time is cumulative, not consecutive, so it doesn’t reset if she moves too far away, nor does it account for the use of other lures, binds, or mundane socializing. Kidnapping attempts by powerful waifus that this lure turned into temporary yanderes are not unknown, but the personal power offered by this lure is its own protection against such events.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c23 c6">Other Controls:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">These methods don’t cleanly fit as either bindings or lures.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Treasure Hoard</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Type:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Other</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Cost:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;10</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Special:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Requires Dragon Musk</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">You may now capture a waifu by biting her, drawing blood, and swallowing a small amount. The bite itself is important, as it establishes dominance, but where you bite doesn’t matter. The core of a tattoo will appear at that spot, just the same as using the Stamp, &nbsp;and may be moved to a more ideal part of her body using the Company app. This may be purchased alongside higher bindings or even No Bindings. Like the stamp, tattoos created by this perk will remain visible until they’re superseded by higher bindings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Dragonblood</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Cost:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;200</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Special:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Requires Dragon Musk.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Every part of a dragon is infused with the concept of power, including their bodily fluids. Drinking large amounts of your fluids, over long periods of time, will make your waifus more powerful, raising their effective tier all the way up to, potentially, 10. Tier 11 waifus are not affected. This is calculated after any tier changes from waifu perks, but before cross-training, equipment, or bindings, and does not affect the attraction bonus from Dragon Musk. If your relationship has already reached this stage, you don’t need the bonus anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A tier 1 waifu will hit tier 2 after her first dose (125 mL). Each tier-up after that requires five times as many doses as the one before it. Assuming she drinks one dose every day, she’ll need over 1,300 years to reach tier 10. Further doses after a waifu hits tier 10 will continue to strengthen her, but without further tier-ups. If one of your waifus has a draconic or serpentine trait or is a catgirl, high concentrations of your essence may give her more and stronger draconic traits or transform her into one entirely. This interaction was first brought to our attention very recently and is still poorly understood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Hotel California</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Type:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Other</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Cost:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;20</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This seemingly-innocuous entertainment or hospitality venue uses a legitimate business of your choice as a cover for mind control. Options include, but are not limited to, a pub, restaurant, amusement park, music venue, circus, casino, and luxury resort. Strip clubs in particular are a perennial favorite. Most customers are only compelled to spend more and bring their friends when they come back, but a very different fate is in store for potential capture targets. As they spend time within your walls, they’ll be beautified according to a blend of your standards and the establishment’s overt purpose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">After some time, your staff will offer each of your targets the chance to experience your business from the other side by helping out with a short performance, or other task, that lasts no more than ten minutes. The building’s compulsion will make them agree; a skill download during the run-up time will more than compensate for any lack of experience or talent. As they do their task, they’ll be further transformed to match your chosen theme and become yours when they’re done. Waifus acquired in this way are considered captured like anyone else.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Themes can be changed at any time, but require you to have at least three purchased or captured waifus who already fit that theme pre-transformation. If you want a robots theme, you need at least three cyborgs, gynoids, or software AIs; if you want maids, you need at least three actual maids or characters who dressed as maids at least once in canon or official art.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The actual building is in a secure dimensional space. Its front entrance uses applied quantum uncertainty to open in random-but-fateful locations throughout the multiverse. Customers will always return to the same universe they came from and won’t notice anything strange about any customers from other worlds that they may encounter within. A side door allows you and your waifus access to your local universe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">You are immune to your own building’s effects, but will be required to experience every one of your employee’s jobs firsthand at least once. (Temporary genderbending and other transformations will be provided if necessary.) Your employees are immune to repeat or any further transformations, unless you reassign them to other positions or choose a new theme, in which case they’ll be changed to fit their new role.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c16">If you have the Alterzelu symbiote, any of your employees who are both </span><span class="c16 c26">not</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;bonded with a symbiote and are alone in an employees-only room for more than a few minutes risk getting attacked by a stray larval symbiote.

Each Command Seal allows you to give one unbreakable order to a Servant under your control, along with a power boost for the duration of the order. The more specific the order and the shorter its duration, the stronger the boost and according compulsion, and vice versa. General orders with indefinite durations can, eventually, be ignored, but a specific command with an instant duration will offer the Servant no chance to resist. One spent Command Seal will regenerate every 24 hours. You may have as many sets of seals as you have purchased or captured Servants, counting only the characters denoted as Servants in this CYOA. The first set of seals is free.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">If you purchase or capture an eligible Master from a published Fate/ work, and have at least one Servant per Master, you can delegate a single Servant to each. Canon Master-Servant pairs take priority: Rin-Artoria Saber, Sakura-Medusa, Sakura-Artoria Saber Alter, Reika-Jackie, Irisviel-Artoria Saber, Kohaku-Okita, Ritsuka-Mash, Hakuno-Nero, Hakuno-Tamamo Caster, Hakuno-Altera. Delegate Masters' Command Seals are free and regenerate independently at the same rate as yours, but still count against your total and cannot be directly used by you. If you ever find yourself in an actual Holy Grail War, and all of your Command Seals are delegated, you will still have an inert set of Seals that may be used to summon, or contract with, a Servant locally. A locally summoned or contracted Servant will not be bound unless you apply a Binding-type control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Each Ruler-class Servant you summon may carry six additional sets of Seals on their body.

Your Command Seals purchase limit now counts all non-Servant waifus of tier 6 or higher, in addition to all Servants.

You replace the personality of one of your purchased waifus and keep all of her powers and special traits, with the exception of crippling, categorical weaknesses; those will be eliminated when you take over, just as if you’d bound your Possess target as a waifu. If your target has the equivalent of any Talent, you get it for free. You must purchase the waifu you intend to possess at her normal price.

If you have the Choker and wear one yourself, you will always be able to deactivate and remove it, even after the normal time limit, and will not suffer any resistance penalties. If you have Symbiotes, you will be your own queen, with no need for a king. If you have a Shroud, its group mind will still center on yourself and you will benefit from all waifu buffs it offers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">If you combine this perk with Yoink, all relevant local records and memories are retconned to include you, and all knowledge and memories that an alternate you who grew up in your starting world, in the body of the character you’re replacing, would have had are downloaded into your head alongside your original memories.

If your natural height was less, you are now at least 190 cm tall - or will be, if you aren’t yet fully grown. Your clothes are all resized and your muscle memory adjusted to fit. (You may opt out of this height boost.) All skin blemishes, unwanted body hair, and detrimental genetic irregularities are erased. You are immune to minor illnesses, but not disease or injury. You also have immortality and eternal youth. If you are older than 25 years, your body is reset to that point, otherwise you'll continue to mature to that point but not experience any aging afterwards. The "Fog of Ages" will never affect you. The individual benefits of this Talent may also apply, at your discretion, to any/all of your purchased and captured waifus.

You have prodigious martial talent and can rapidly learn any personal, non-supernatural combat skills you encounter, whether melee or ranged. This is an experience and skill acquisition multiplier, not a flat improvement, and scales to the strength and skill of your opponents and trainers: the better they are than you, the faster you learn, until you’ve caught up to them.

You have a knack for living in the wilderness, with a natural feel for how to identify and make use of edible food, potable water, suitable shelter, animal tracks, etc. Non-sapient living beasts that are smaller than you will not attack without provocation; sapient ones who don’t want you or anyone else around will talk first. You know how to ride a mundane horse.

You can read a room, spot deceit or employ your own, know when to speak and when to hold your tongue, and find the right words to say for good or ill. You will neither be That Guy whom women warn their friends about, nor the otaku nerd whose obsessions drive others away. This does not lend any additional power to your words - that’s what Siren’s Song is for - nor will it make you enjoy social interactions for their own sake. It only guarantees knowledge and competence. You are also immediately fluent in any spoken language you encounter and will speak it like any native in only a few days, with mastery of the written form taking a week on average; this part always applies to your waifus as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">Psychic Talent</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Cost:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;15</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">You think.

Unlike the buffs from Dragon and Shroud elements, &nbsp;this is an experience and skill acquisition multiplier, not a flat improvement. This effect scales to the strength and skill of your opponents and trainers: the better they are than you, the faster you learn, until you’ve caught up to them.

If you are transformed by such an effect, you may easily return to normal, entirely or in piecemeal, whenever you want. This still does not protect against injury or provide any sort of healing factor; if you want one, you’ll have to find it yourself.

However you set the landscape, it will populate itself with biome-appropriate wildlife from a recognizable Earth, without any issues from invasive species, implanted transmitters, pollutants, unwanted predators, etc. If you also purchase Catch-a-Ride, your vehicle will be parked in an attached garage. If you also purchase Heavenbuilt Proto, your starship will be able to enter and land in your pocket universe even without a multiversal drive.

Portal sites are procedurally generated in each world, generally appearing near locations that are important or useful to you or your purchased and captured waifus. Portals will activate automatically when approached by a valid user: you, your waifus, and friendlies you invite, and deactivate automatically when not used. You and your waifus can sense the nearest portal’s location even without a map, and more precisely the closer you are to it; this is no replacement for a true map. Neutral, hostile, and uninvited eyes will not notice a portal’s presence, activation, or use, and cannot pass through. Some independent multiverse travelers may enter your universe directly, but only if they’re non-hostile and have a beacon to follow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Your first portal will only lead to your starting world. The more things you do there, whether that’s capturing local waifus, defeating baddies, or otherwise accomplishing story goals, the more quickly you’ll unlock new worlds to visit. You may also unlock new worlds by either traveling there yourself or capturing a waifu who’s been there personally. All purchased waifus, without the Yoink perk, have only been to one other world: the factory where they were made.

The default respawn time for your waifus is 72 hours; each amazon waifu you purchase or capture will cut this in half. They will retain all of their previous incarnation’s memories, including anything related to their previous incarnation’s cause of death, except for some minor trauma reduction. All relevant effects of Lures, Binds, Perks, and waifu perks will be re-applied before shipment. If a waifu has a soulbound artifact along the lines of an Exaltation or Sacred Gear, an exact duplicate of the artifact will be produced for her specifically, and persist through respawns, and the original one released back into the waifu’s homeworld.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c23 c6">Waifu Perks:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Each waifu perk may only be purchased once and applied only to a qualified waifu.

Sin acts as a superheavy battlecarrier, capable of operating in all planetary and void environments, and can be sustained indefinitely without cost. Sin has all of its normal weaponry, including gravity and dream magic, and an uncountably high number of Sinscales, Sinspawn, and fiends that may be deployed in army-scale engagements or as anti-boarding defense. At least four layers of interior pocket universes serve as further protection and segregate the fiends from the customizable command and living spaces near the aeon’s core. An empathic link connects the summoner’s will to Sin and, in turn, the fiends that protect it. This link doubles as an IFF, preventing any deadly or otherwise unfortunate encounters between Sin’s guards and its guests or other inhabitants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5 c6">The Word of the Mother</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Waifu:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Minfilia Warde</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Cost:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;998 (T2 -&gt; T10)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Art:</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/post/show/3219373&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592416761124000">link</a></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Above and beyond her own power, Minfilia channels the existence of the Primal most ancient and famous - Hydaelyn.

This version even has some slight improvements over the original. First, the condition of the vehicle is now tied to da Vinci's own health. As long as she is in top condition, the Shadow Border will self-repair from any damage taken. This only works one way, so da Vinci can't be injured by attacking the Shadow Border. Second, it can Zero Sail through Imaginary Number Space and into other universes. Much like traveling to Lostbelts, however, you must establish a connection with something or someone in the target universe so you can anchor yourself to that location. In your case, captured and yoinked waifus count for their respective universes of origin. Finally, Zero-Sailing is now 100% nonlethal. It still has a tendency to... misfire somewhat at times, but you’ll always end up in a place where you </span><span class="c16">needed</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to be, even if it isn’t where you wanted to go.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Sion TATARI</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Waifu:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Sion Eltnam Atlasia</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Cost:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;0 (T6 -&gt; T6)</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Art:</span><span class="c16">&nbsp;</span><span class="c4"><a class="c9" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/post/show/18962285&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1592416761141000">link</a></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Sion is fused with the 13th Dead Apostle Ancestor, the Night of Wallachia aka TATARI.

Akeno is a Fallen by default. Asia, Irina, and Xenovia are humans by default. All DxD humans, Angels, Fallen, and Devils become Angels when Lightbound and Devils when Shadowbound. This can be applied to other characters if you already have at least one genuine DxD example of the target race. Bound Angels, including Fallen, may Fall and Rise at your discretion.

Hachikuji Mayoi can apply a Lost Cow status effect to a nearby target for 24 hours or until the target finds what they're looking for, whichever comes first, and is otherwise is the tough adult version from Kabukimonogatari. Senogku Nadeko is the snake goddess version from Koimonogatari. Hanekawa Tsubasa has her stripey-hair makeover, can transform into Black Hanekawa at will, and can summon the tiger Kako as the Stand [Eye of the Tiger].

This power is inactive by default. You and all purchased and captured waifus are immune. Koga Tomoe can create and end time loops of up to 30 days - basically Akemi Homura with all non-temporal abilities removed. You and all purchased and captured waifus are aware of Tomoe's loops. Futaba Rio can spawn one clone of herself at a time and live both lives separately. Both Rios are equally real until one despawns. Toyohama Nodoka can swap minds and souls between bodies. Her time limit is 72 hours, unless she swaps herself, in which case the effect is indefinite until she cancels it. Makinohara Shouko is the adult version from the movie. Her time travel method isn't particularly versatile, but it doesn't need technology. Azusagawa Kaede gives all your waifus cute, animal-themed onesies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">To Aru Series:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The Misaka Network is just Misaka Worst and Last Order.

Anima’s human form can't use Pain or Oblivion, but knows all generic skills/spells from FFX by default. Her Aeon form is mobile, with no chains and a complete lower body. Her original lower half, "the Shadow," has its own complete lower body and lives in an explicit pocket universe. Oblivion feeds a target to the Shadow like normal. Anima may also temporarily switch places with her Shadow; this tends to result in extreme collateral damage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Final Fantasy - other:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;White Mage has her 8-Bit Theater characterization. If you have a waifu from FFV, the four Crystals will spawn not too far out of your way, allowing you and your waifus access to the game’s job system. If you have at least one waifu from FFVII and Sweet Home, Mako Springs will appear in your Home and produce natural Materia at an accelerated rate. Lightning, Vanille, and Fang have Odin, Hecatoncheir, and Bahamut, respectively.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Halo:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Cortana will be plugged into your smart device.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">League of Legends:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Anivia and Rek’Sai can switch between humanoid and bestial forms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">The Legend of Zelda:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Midna cannot take her imp form by default and would strongly prefer not to ever again. She instead has a strong affinity for shadow magic, capable of melting into shadows and teleporting through a world’s Twilight Realm, even if it doesn’t have one or she’s Bound by a Shroud of a different element. The imp form may still be remade as a shadow magic spell. Fi brings the Master Sword with her, as if she was a Unison Device from MGLN.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Mass Effect:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;EDI is just the gynoid from ME3.

Vampires no longer suffer from any of their weaknesses. Hellebron and Morathi are both young again. Khalida is alive and young again. Valkia is metaphysically separated from Khorne.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Xenoblade:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Pneuma can split off Pyra and Mythra into their own bodies, at will, and reabsorb them with physical contact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Cthulhu Mythos:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Includes original works and modern adaptations such as Demonbane or Haiyore!Nyaruko-san.

If you buy a Pseudo-Servant waifu perk for a captured character, the Servant’s memories and personality will seamlessly integrate into the host’s, in much the same way as the Extra/Possess/Substitute perks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Nasuverse - not mutually exclusive:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Kama and BB with any Sakura and each other; Ereshkigal and Space Ishtar with any Rin and each other; Scáthach and Skadi; Carmilla and Elizabeth Bathory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Nasuverse - Command Seals:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;The following characters count as valid Masters: mainline Rin, mainline Sakura, mainline Illya, mainline Luvia, Bazette, Caren, Kaleido Ruby, Kaleido Sapphire, Sola-Ui, Irisviel, Hakuno, Devil Kiara, Kohaku, Prisma Illya, Miyu, Angelica, Celenike, Fiore, Reika, Sakura Edelfelt, Prelati, Ayaka, Manaka, Reines, Yvette, Hishiri, Ritsuka, Yu, Ophelia. Pseudo-Servants and Demi-Servants are Servants, not Masters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Nasuverse - Alternate classes and outfits:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;All Servants with Summer, Santa, or Halloween forms can use the associated skills and NPs at will. The same applies to Atalanta’s, Boudica’s, Da Vinci’s, Medusa’s, Nero’s, and Nobunaga’s alternate classes, except for Avenger Gorgon. Okita’s summer cyborgization cured her tuberculosis in canon; it remains cured here even if she only uses her Saber abilities. All Servants with alternate outfits, whether from alternate classes or the alternate skins from Craft Essences or the Moon Cell games, can don them if they have a place to change. If you have Sweet Home or Heavenbuilt, these outfits will be physically stored in the Servants’ rooms.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Nasuverse - Other Servant details:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Captured Servants are no longer connected to the Throne of Heroes and will not affect their greater Heroic Spirits. All Servants exist in a quantum state where they are both fully incarnated and able to enter Spirit Form. The true love condition for Tomoe Gozen’s NP is transferred to you. Hundred Faces Hassan’s main body is the adult female one. Carmilla’s Femme Fatale (False) does not affect her feelings toward you. If you Substitute into Sakamoto Ryouma, you’ll receive his partner Oryou for free. Mysterious Heroines X and XA have adult bodies. Saint Martha has her dragon, Tarrasque. Empyreal Eye overuse may cause Musashi to travel between worlds and eras on her own; if that happens and you have Sweet Home, the portal room will connect to her new location as if it were intentional. She can learn to control this ability with practice. Nero Claudius’s Saber Venus form is not possible without special circumstances. If you purchase Dioscuri, Castor will be genderswapped so the two are identical twins once more. BB has lost her connection to Nyarlathotep. If you buy or capture BB anytime after buying at least one of Passionlip, Meltryllis, Kingprotea, Kazuradrop, or Violet, all credits that you paid for those five will be refunded.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Magical Girls - Lyrical Nanoha:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Tsukimura Suzuka is a vampire, as implied by Triangle Hearts. Fate Testarossa has Arf. Precia Testarossa has Linith. Signum has Agito. Hayate has Reinforce Zwei. If you already have Arf when you buy Fate, Linith when you buy Precia, Agito when you buy Signum, or Reinforce Zwei when you buy Hayate, you’ll be refunded the appropriate familiars’ full costs. If you’ve paid at least 200 for Reinforce Zwei and any Wolkenritter (Shamal, Signum, Vita, Zafira), you get the rest for free and their cost is refunded down to 200. If you have the full set of Wolkenritter, Hayate’s price is discounted to 50. “The Numbers” may be bought twice. If you buy six Numbers a la carte, you’ll be refunded the cost of four of them, as if you had paid for a set of six; if you buy twelve a la carte, you’ll be refunded the cost of eight of them, as if you had paid for two sets of six. All youth characters from Vivid and Vivid Strike are aged up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Magical Girls - Madoka Magicka:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;A meguca’s phylactery is her body, not her soul gem. That is instead a limit break meter that glows more brightly as it fills. Anything that a meguca does in combat will add to this gauge, with the greatest effects coming from Strategy (ex: planning and coordination, doling out buffs and debuffs, inflicting status effects, and healing oneself and others), Suffering (ex: getting hurt, seeing one’s friends get hurt, fighting on despite heavy injury, debilitating status, or fallen friends), Style (Touhou-style grazing plus Exalted stunt mechanics - if it looks cool enough, it counts), and Success (ex: harming foes, killing foes, winning skirmishes). When a meguca’s gem is filled, she can call forth her Witch as a special attack. With a stream of magic coming from you that they can use to regenerate, a meguca can only die if her body is completely obliterated. If you already have regular Madoka and Homura, the T11 Madokami purchase will upgrade the two into their divine versions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Magical Girls - Precure:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Individuals in cooperation-required Cure teams (White and Black, Bloom and Egret, Magical and Miracle, Ma Cherie and Amour) may be bought separately. Their powers will still function without their partners. Milky Rose and Ace do not have time limits. All transformation devices that are also familiars, including White’s and Black’s, are simple, non-living magitech. All other power boosts that a Cure’s familiar usually provides will instead come from you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Magical Girls - Sailor Moon:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Anime Usagi and Manga Usagi are mutually exclusive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Magical Girls - Symphogear:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;All Gear users have their Gears; all Alchemists have Faust Robes. The FIS trio (Maria, Kirika, Shirabe) have full Gear compatibility without LiNKER. Elfnein has a fully-functional adult body. Kanade and Serena are alternate-timeline versions from XDU. Carol has all four of her Autoscorers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Touhou:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Yukari has Ran and Chen. Ran alone still has Chen. If you buy or capture Yukari after buying Ran, the credits you paid for Ran will be refunded. If you have Sweet Home and purchased every waifu from the Scarlet Devil Mansion, a copy of the mansion will appear in your world. If you have Sweet Home or Heavenbuilt, and have captured every waifu from the Scarlet Devil Mansion, a permanent portal will connect your world or ship to the mansion's interior, following the same rules as Sweet Home's regular portals. This also applies to the Eientei and Moriya Shrine crews.</span></p></div><div id="footer"><span>Published by <a target="_blank" title="Learn more about Google Drive" href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Drive</a></span><span class="dash">–</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/u/0/abuse?id=AKkXjoy_EDKq9pSCiBfciAwzDV3jcMKOhnlQURPX89D4RjGEqfE6pY-7ZnmP0nCwY7MhNLk9V1ES_mhohwfhG7Y:0">Report Abuse</a></div><script type="text/javascript" nonce="">(function(){/*
