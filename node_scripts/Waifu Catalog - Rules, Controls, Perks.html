The Company’s Waifus and Husbandos are all clones manufactured on demand, except where noted. They come packaged with their iconic ou</span><span>tfits, personal equipment, and familiars or treasured pets, when appropriate.

This is typically achieved by using a Binding-type or certain Other Controls, or when a target gives you a sincere confession of love</span><span>&nbsp;- usually</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;romantic, but </span><span>false positives occasionally happen and trigger a capture that isn’t entirely merited. (This love</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;may be assisted by any means, including the use of Lure-type controls or third-party mind co</span><span>ntrol</span><span class="c7">.) Capturing a Tier 1-10 waifu or husbando adds </span><span>6</span><span class="c1">0% of their purchase value to your account, rounded up to the nearest whole number. Capture credits are not granted for local versions of waifus or husbandos that you’ve purchased or alternate versions that you’ve already captured once, unless they’re a unique entry in the lists proper or as a waifu perk. Waifus and husbandos not named on any list may also be captured for credits, provided they have at least two of the following in their original canon: name, personality/backstory, abilities/skills/powers, and appearance/design. As an author, you must rate these characters’ tiers yourself.

If the local space is too warped for that distance to be accurate, you may also recall it manually.

If you choose this instead, ignore the entire list of regular waifus. Instead, go to the Tier 11 list on the fifth page of </span><span class="c7">the spreadsheet</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;and spend your special ticket on one and only one of the waifus there. You must spend this </span><span>starting ticket on</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>a</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;Tier 11 waifu or husbando.

You may still encounter other contractors, but the multiverse is big, really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-boggling big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to the multiverse. You can easily go entire lifetimes without meeting even one.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.ltk3lquy3xmm"><span class="c12 c0">With A Little Help From My Friends (Cooperative)</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Intensity</span><span class="c0">:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;+20%</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Special:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Chargen only</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You aren’t the only player in your game.

All opposing contractors will have legal builds. Their budgets are equal to your total credit income plus the sum of capture+sale values of all retinue members (according to their effective tier after step 5) that you've stolen from other contractors - see below - plus 1% of that sum per contractor you’ve defeated (non-compounding) and then rounded up to the next whole number. Tier 11 tickets count for their exchange value, 2000 credits each.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In formula form:</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><img src="./Waifu Catalog - Rules, Controls, Perks_files/chart"></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">C= Your total credit income</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">R= Capture+Sale value of retinue members you’ve stolen</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">E= Number of eliminated Contractors</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Each time you defeat or otherwise handle another contractor, you will have seven days to rest before encountering a new one, with more experience and skill than the last. Their expenses will be more optimized; their retinue members will be more divergent from their canon selves in ability, equipment, and personality; and the more third-party resources they’ll have. The qualitative side of this difficulty ramp stops after 50 victories, though your opponents’ budgets will continue to increase. The rest period between challengers will decrease by 24 hours for every seven wins you accumulate, to a minimum of one hour.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.1mpfie1ktyvn"><span class="c12 c0">Types of Opponents</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You will encounter three kinds of opponents in PvP. The first are people you can negotiate with - Negotiables, for lack of a better term. While they may have an agenda that runs counter to yours, they will not become hostile unless provoked by some means: competition over the same capture target, a breach of ethical standards, manipulation by local parties, or just self-defense against your aggression. Negotiable contractors count as defeated once they’re either killed or permanently accommodated.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The second are Rivals. They don’t have an issue with you in particular, but you will stand directly in the way of their goals: their list of local capture targets overlaps with yours, you and they want a member of each other’s retinue and aren’t willing to back off or trade, members of your retinues know each other and want their counterpart to join them, etc. If you leave for another world, your rival will connect to that world too and have objectives there that are incompatible with your own. Rivals are defeated when they are no longer capable and/or willing to pursue their goals.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The third type of opponent, and the most dangerous, are Enemies. When you and an enemy are first connected to the same world, your smart devices will receive alerts with each other’s name and face: as you look at that moment, minus any makeup. Like rivals, enemies will also pursue you across worlds. Assume that every enemy you encounter seeks to stripmine your visited worlds of all credit value, claim your retinue as their own, or even sell them off for credits. The only choice is to kill or be killed.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.axaznk2hxwwy"><span class="c12 c0">NTR is a Trash Fetish (PvP Capturing)</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If a member of a retinue is captured by an enemy and held in their territory (whether that territory is purchased from the company or acquired locally) for a period of 24 hours, the hostage loses the benefits of Mind Defense until rescued. The timer begins only when the hostage is both defeated and restrained, and it will reset if they are touched by their master or leave enemy territory unrestrained. The timer will pause if they leave while still restrained by the enemy.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Once the timer has run its course, the kidnapper is free to use any bindings, lures, or third-party mind control methods they have as if the hostage were free. Targets stolen from another contractor are worth 0 capture credits, but may be sold at the usual rate, adjusting for their effective tier after step 5. T11s are an exemption to this and maintain their normal rates for capture and sale. Recapturing one of your own waifus does not grant any credits.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.5dqvwzmjz2bx"><span class="c12 c0">Special PvP Rules</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Yoink and Substitute are not available in ladder PvP. Unlike in other modes, a new ladder participant’s starting world is hidden from them. The client still chooses their starting world’s danger rating, but the master of their story chooses which world within that danger rating the client begins in.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">To better facilitate meaningful conflict, the following debuffs of other perks are in place for any interactions between you (and your retinue) and your opponent (and their retinue). These debuffs do not apply to interactions between yourself and natives of your current universe or contractors encountered outside of PvP matches.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have a Pocket Apartment or higher, the location is integrated into the local environment for as long as you’re connected to that world. The locals will not notice its appearance or disappearance. Conjunction, Apportation, and Warranty Plan’s killswitch are all disabled while on your opponent’s home turf. Body, Wild, and Soul Defense are disabled for PvP as well.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Warranty Plan’s resurrections will not occur until the current match ends. At that point, the winner may pay to respawn any slain members of their opponent’s retinue into their own for the purchase price equal to that of the member’s effective tier up to step 5. You may also revive slain opponents into your retinue for free, with a one-time genderbend for each if your orientation demands it. These two opportunities are lost if not used. Defeated opponents otherwise function identically to your other retinue members. They keep their heritages, but their binding methods are replaced by yours.</span></p><h2 class="c22" id="h.xfjytgsm2xhz"><span class="c31 c19 c17">PvP Conditions</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You may personalize the difficulty of your PVP experience with the following options. Budget increases are additive and are determined based on your starting budget, before any purchases, except where noted. If taken with a Danger 11 start, the extra funds are calculated relative to a starting budget of 4,045 and will become available immediately after character generation.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.aygud0ib5v56"><span class="c12 c0">One In Ten</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Intensity:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Flat +50.

Bonds between your waifus grow more quickly with increased interaction, but will not override familial relationships without significant pressure. Waifu obedience is not absolute. Waifus, in general, put the spirit of your orders over the letter. Strong-willed waifus may elect to ignore disliked orders and follow their own initiative; more often, a competent waifu whose moral alignment conflicts with an order’s means or ends will raise an objection and the two of you will have to argue it out. Bound waifus are also somewhat more likely, depending on their moral alignments, to consider “Just bind her and make her one of us” a valid solution to any problem involving a waifu candidate. Even the purest-hearted waifus can find themselves seduced by the power to turn any enemy into a friend.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">With one exception, all bindings work equally well regardless of sex, gender, or orientation. This exception is noted in the binding’s description.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">For safety reasons, all purchased waifus are bound with one of the Stamp’s tattoos before delivery, unless you opt out of having any bindings. You can have no more than one binding method at any time. When you buy a new binding method, your previous one will be automatically refunded and disappear from existence; any unique mental effects and most physical effects will fade over the next few days. Long-term conditioning from the Choker is an exception, as are the Stamp’s tattoos. The latter will merely become dormant (invisible and inert) while any higher binding is applied. If a waifu was never Stamped, whether by you or before delivery, the use of any higher binding method will also give her a dormant tattoo; this is what marks her as one of your captures. Dormant tattoos</span><span>&nbsp;turn active when higher bindings are removed.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If you have any binding, but capture a waifu using only Lures, the Stamp’s effects will apply regardless and her full tattoo will appear immediately.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Binding or capturing any waifu whose powers come from an external, (semi-)sapient source will permanently sever their connection and replicate those powers as innate abilities. All waifus whose power comes with a crippling, categorical weakness, such as vampires, Kryptonians, or Devil Fruit users, will be no more affected by that weakness than an ordinary human. Both of these processes have already been applied to all purchased waifus, regardless of whether or not they’re bound. The latter will also apply to you, if you accept such a power. Like all </span><span>company-supplied powers, bindings cannot be stolen or copied.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.q5fbrhkavmyg"><span class="c12 c0">No Bindings</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Binding</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;All waifus of tiers 2-10 are discounted by one full rank.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">None of your waifus will be affected by any of the effects common to all Company bindings…. you crazy bastard.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you purchase and use a real binding method later, the discount will disappear and you will not be allowed to purchase more waifus or perks until you pay off the debt. You do not need to bind your previously-purchased waifus immediately or pay off the whole debt at once, but you may not make any new purchases if you have negative credits. Capturing any waifu without bindings will award you the standard capture value of her original tier, before this option’s purchase discount. It will also give her a dormant tattoo, which you can activate at any time by using the Stamp (should you purchase it) or removing a higher Binding. If you instead switch to this option after already having bound waifus, the basic effects common to all bindings will persist in your retinue members until interactions or events change their minds naturally.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.2f79y78zajr1"><span class="c12 c0">Stamp</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Binding</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;0</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This permanent magical tattoo instills only the mental effects common to all bindings.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">To capture waifus, you may apply this tattoo using a thumb-sized ink stamp. Only you and your purchased and captured waifus can perceive the stamp when it’s not in use. The most popular stamping sites are typically to the pubic region, lower back, or back of the neck. The inked part, on one end, contains the tattoo’s core, a circular design that serves as your emblem. Newly-applied tattoos require 72 hours to ramp up to their full effect. Stamped targets only count as captured when the tattoo completes. </span><span>A stamp’s location on a target’s body may be repositioned after the fact through the company app; a generated 3D model of the target serves as a reference.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">During the ramp-up period, additional ink will fill itself in around your emblem to form a much more elaborate design, about the size of the waifu’s palm, that represents her history and personality. Captured waifus and people they know will not notice a tattoo-in-progress until it completes itself, at which point they’ll rationalize away its sudden appearance. Completed tattoos are always perceptible. If a tattoo’s location is ever damaged or severed, its effects will continue and it will reappear when the skin is regenerated or the body part replaced.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The stamp never runs out of ink and cannot be used accidentally. If you are stamped, by yourself or another, it will only have cosmetic effects. If one of your waifus marks a new girl with it, the new girl will feel its effects as if you had used it on her yourself. The anti-loss, -theft, and -destruction measures on the Company’s smart device also apply to this stamp.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.uod77wt6ugg4"><span class="c0 c12">Tempest Jewelry</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Binding</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;10</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Magitech chokers, bracelets, or anklets that enforce absolute obedience. Items are available in ruby, orange topaz, citrine, emerald, sapphire, amethyst, alexandrite, and clear and black diamond varieties. Bands may be leather, silk, or metal. This binding will be applied to purchased waifus before delivery. You receive one new choker each day, up to a limit in reserve of 5 or the number of items currently active, whichever is greater.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Wearers will perform any order you give them, within the realm of physical or mental possibility. Orders do not need to be </span><span class="c7 c8">consciously</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;possible. Will-saves, intelligence-saves, or reinterpretations are not allowed. Even if a wearer wants to resist, their body or mind will perform as ordered regardless. Unlike other binding methods, </span><span>these items tend to enforce your exact words, not your intent: “Do X” and “Make and follow a plan to do X” can have vastly different results.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">When a choker's (bracelets, anklets) latch is first closed around a wearer, the latch disappears and manual removal becomes impossible. Active chokers are indestructible and may not otherwise be warped away. If a wearer dematerializes, or otherwise transforms away from a standard humanoid height and build, the choker will disappear with or into the wearer for the duration. Removal of a wearer's own choker becomes unthinkable after one full week (168 hours). If you (the </span><span>contractor</span><span class="c1">) wear a choker, you may deactivate and remove your choker at any time. You are your own master and not subject to absolute obedience or any such mind control.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">You may deactivate any of your retinue's jewelry through the associated software, installed as an app on your smart device. The latch will reappear and may then undone (and the item removed) normally. Your retinue may use </span><span>other app features added by expansion perks, but</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;cannot perceive the deactivation option. (They may still </span><span class="c7 c8">use</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>it if directly ordered.)</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This app will uninstall itself if you trade in the Jewelry for a more advanced Binding.

Some assembly is required.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Your circles may be drawn in any material: chalk, ink, carvings, sticks on the ground, blood, or even light. The circle's area of effect may either be a sphere, which the circle rings, or a cylinder reaching out twice as high as its diameter in one direction. The target must remain within the circle for the time required. If they leave the area of effect before the binding is complete, its progress will stop and begin to reverse. If they are not brought back within the area of effect within 24 hours, progress is reset. The circle only affects those with the parameters set upon its design, whether that's an individual or category. Binding circles will always exclude you and your retinue members who are already bound through a circle, even when set to "Affect all."</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Once bound via a circle, a targeted waifu is put into a hypnotic trance. While in this trance, you may command them freely and implant suggestions. You may also switch them back to their original personality (after the generic effects for all bindings), via an activation phrase or action, or return them into their hypnotic trance for additional orders.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">When designing a circle, you spend points to determine its quality. By default, you have 6 points to spend as desired. Additional points may be acquired via an expansion perk. After inputting the targeting and quality parameters, wait for the company app to provide details on how to draw the circle. It should only take a few minutes. More powerful circles require more detailed inscriptions and designs to create. You may save designs for future use. The chart and notes on its use are found in the Additional Notes section.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If the circle is damaged or interrupted for more than a minute, the circle will fail and progress will be lost.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.32o2wox14h4h"><span class="c12 c0">Alterzelu Symbiote</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Binding</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c15">Cost: </span><span class="c1">100</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">A set of black eggs appear scattered around your starting location or safehouse, one for each of your purchased waifus. Each one contains an alien symbiote guided by your mental commands, which will instinctively attack and merge with women in a sexual manner. Your purchased waifus will all be stamped with the default tattoos before arrival, except for one waifu whom you’ve designated as the queen. Her symbiote has already hatched from its egg and bonded with her.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">In addition to their basic effects, the default binding tattoos will prevent purchased waifus from lethally harming your symbiote larvae. Waifus captured in other ways will usually accept the symbiote outright if they know you want them to. You will immediately be bonded w</span><span>ith a symbiote upon buying this control method, even i</span><span class="c7">f you do not purchase any waifus in your starting build. In that case, </span><span>you will start with no more than five larvae; </span><span class="c1">the first target to fall victim to one of your symbiotes or be transformed by any other symbiote-related binding method will become your queen.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Your first s</span><span class="c7">ymbiote larvae hatch fully-g</span><span>rown and</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;are comparable in size to a small dog or wild cat, such as a beagle or lynx. They are perfectly concealed until they attack a waifu, and cannot be fought off by any waifu of Tier 5 or below. When a symbiote attacks a waifu, it will latch onto her back, aligning its spine with hers, then penetrate her with its tail and engulf her head with its own. It then pumps a transformative fluid into her from both ends, merging their bodies together into a more idealized, sexual form. This initial transformation causes severe growth of the breasts, belly, and</span><span>/or</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;rear and thighs</span><span>. (Using the scales defined in Tempest Runes II, distribute a pool totaling 200% among the three categories. The entire pool must be distributed.)</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;This initial growth is not optional, but may recede after the fact</span><span>&nbsp;at a rate of 3 percentage points every 5 hours. The full extent of this recession, if any, depends on practical concerns and your personal preference.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">The designated queen can </span><span>produce</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;new Alterzelu eggs</span><span>, which will hatch to produce new larvae. See the Offspring section for details.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;You and your queen may also convert a target in person by transmitting the same transformative fluid from her mouth or tail. This trades speed and immediate effect for subtlety; </span><span>you or your queen </span><span class="c7">can let </span><span>your</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;tail out without the rest of the armor, </span><span>make out or have</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span>sex with the conversion target</span><span class="c7">, and then leave before the real transformation begins. The normally</span><span>-phallic tip of a host’s tail can invert itself for use against male targets.</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;Regardless of whether a target was taken by a larva or transformed by </span><span>your or your queen</span><span class="c1">, the initial transformation will induce a surge of lust that will only fade when satisfied by you or another symbiote host whose lust surge has previously been satisfied. Capture credits are rewarded once this lust has faded.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Symbiosis alters the target’s mind, making her see you as either her mate or king, whose orders are to be obeyed and whose survival is paramount to the species. All symbiote</span><span>&nbsp;hosts besides yourself</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;will see the queen as the first among them, regardless of previous relationships, and arrange themselves into a pyramidal hierarchy beneath her. </span><span>Symbiote hosts’ personalities are otherwise unchanged.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">You and all waifus benefit from Everlasting Talent, Body Talent, Martial Talent, Wild Talent, Body Defense, and Wild Defense. (Take th</span><span>o</span><span class="c7">se s</span><span>ix</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;perks for free. If you already have some of these perks when you buy the Symbiote, you may claim a discount equal to the total value of the ones you had already purchased. The cost of the Symbiote may not be discounted to below 20 credits.) Hosts gain superhuman senses, strength, agility, and durability; this is enough to push any blue-star waifu up to Tier 4 or any copper-star waifu up one tier, but is not a significant gain for higher tiers.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Alterzelu hosts can, at will, form an environmentally-sealed suit of bio-armor, with Gigeresque black chitin aesthetics, a retractable helmet, sharp claws, and a long tail for combat and maneuverability. This includes you. Existing enchanted gear or otherwise super outfits, such as Life Fibers, power armor, or magical girl uniforms, will be integrated into this bio-armor.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If your chosen queen has canonical themes of corruption, purification, or transformation-of-others, or are known for spawning and controlling large numbers of mooks, all stages of the symbiote life cycle will follow their aesthetic and theming instead: whether egg, larva, or bonded host. Such queens include (but are not limited to) Salem, Dark Samus, Drowned Ophelia, Madokami, the Nasuverse versions of Tiamat and Medb, and waifus affected by the November Rain, Prime Evil, Spawning Pools, Tainted Vessel, Giga-Graviton, and Metroid DNA perks.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">If you Possessed or Substituted a waifu or are otherwise female, you may act as your own queen, with no need for a king - just consorts at most. </span><span>A lone female in an otherwise all-male hive will always be the queen, while an all-male hive will have to externalize its egg production by some means. </span><span class="c7">If desired, </span><span>f</span><span class="c7">emale symbiote masters may subject themselves to the</span><span>&nbsp;same thickening as their hive members; this must be manually triggered with the aid of a larva or hive member. Individual hive members may be re-thickened in the same way, at any time.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If your queen is part of a set that can only be purchased as one, the actual queen is the most dominant one according to their natural personalities; if the members of the set are truly co-equal, then they’ll serve as co-equal queens.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.8fgenesfkcg2"><span class="c12 c0">Shroud of Power</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Binding</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;80</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You gain a semi-sapient cape of solidified magic that acts as an extension of your will. It shifts and transforms at a thought, even unconscious ones. By draping it over or wrapping up a waifu with it, you are able to infuse your target with your will and bind them to it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This cape is subject to the same protections as the company smart device. It can shift its form and texture into a wide variety of shapes and imitate any other outfit, ropes, tendrils, hands, blades, and similar forms. The constructs of the Shroud may have the textures and forms of textiles like leathers, latex, or other forms of clothing. The shroud is extremely durable and capable of significant amounts of strength and speed, and you gain a form of tactile feedback from it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In order to capture a waifu, you or your Shroud must maintain contact with her or one of her projections until sufficient Will is infused into her, whether by her wearing an outfit your Shroud has been transformed into, being cocooned by your Shroud’s tentacle constructs, or similar. As a general rule, the more of your Shroud is focused on, inside of, or otherwise in contact with your target, the less time it takes. The greater the power, will, or resistance your target has, the longer it will take. With the entirety of your Shroud around a target, even if they put their all into the struggle, it will usually take less than a minute for a blue-star waifu, under ten minutes for a copper-star waifu, an hour for a silver-star waifu, three hours for a gold-star waifu, and 12 hours for a T11 waifu. Lesser amounts of your Shroud in contact with a waifu, or only intermittent contact, will extend the time required, up to years.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Other factors can reduce the required time. Examples include the number of orifices your Shroud has penetrated, any of your essence/fluids you have inside her, or if she’s unconscious, been recently defeated by you or your retinue, having sex with your or your retinue, or consenting to the bind. As a general rule, each additional factor reduces the time required to complete the infusion by half. A willing and aware (but not necessarily informed or ‘unassisted’ consent) target can make the process functionally instantaneous regardless of their personal power.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Once completely infused, the waifu becomes one of your Shroud-bound. A newly Shroud-bound waifu’s clothes and makeup are absorbed into a cloak of her own, subordinate to your Shroud, and replaced with a new thematic style in line with your tastes and the personal mark of your stamp. Existing enchanted gear or otherwise super outfits, such as Life Fibers, power armor, or magical girl uniforms, will be integrated into this cloak, as will any upgrades added after the fact. A Shroud-bound waifu will always consider her cloak her most comfortable outfit, but she may still dismiss it and wear normal outfits at any time. Both of you will be able to manipulate this outfit much like you can your Shroud, though your will supersedes hers in such manners. These powers are innate abilities, granted by the Shroud, and do not require any magical talent. Altogether, this is enough to push any blue-star waifu up to Tier 4 or any copper-star waifu up one tier, but is not a significant gain for higher tiers.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Until she is bound, your accumulated will within her will slowly dissipate whenever she loses contact with your Shroud. It takes approximately a month for the process to completely reset for a waifu who’s just short of being fully captured. By default, Shroud-bound do not count as your Shroud for the purposes of binding new waifus. Direct contact with one will, however, delay the fading of any will you've already built up within her.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Once Shroud-bound, a new capture gains an unconscious awareness of your activity and needs. They may even respond to orders you haven’t consciously given yet. They will greatly struggle to go against your direct orders, and even the strongest willed waifus will be unable to go against your intent once bound. Additionally, the infusion will shift Shroud-bound waifus’ figures to your tastes.</span></p><a id="id.kguxdv4224xk"></a><h2 class="c22" id="h.2sazd23f4s8c"><span class="c31 c19 c17">Lures</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c7">Lure-type controls are more subtle than bindings, but cannot directly capture targets.

Just one taste is enough to hook a waifu for life - assuming, of course, that she can taste. Even if she doesn't like you, she'll be unable to imagine a world where she can't eat your cooking every day, and stay with you for that alone. Over time, you can leverage this dependence into obedience through simple operant conditioning and, in turn, create real affection by enforcing faked affection. The quality of your ingredients doesn’t matter, but they must be </span><span class="c7 c8">real</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;ingredients. This lure will not let you cook without the proper tools, unless you have an adequate substitute. This lure also covers drink-mixing, butchery, and chemical food processing, but does not help with gardening, farming, animal husbandry, fishing, etc. - that’s biology, not chemistry. If you want to use this lure’s gifts as a professional skill, you can dial your ability down to world-class-chef levels, enough to ensure great business (and plenty of repeat customers) without tripping any "this food might be literally addictive" alarms.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.s56qh3fv11wi"><span class="c12 c0">Love Spot</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Lure</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;20</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Just like Diarmuid's in Fate/Zero: you gain a mole under one of your eyes that fascinates any woman who sees it and makes them infatuated with you on the... spot.

The charm effect relies on line-of-sight: it may be blocked by covering up the alluring asset, but not turned off. The effect intensifies with exposure.

You have also gained some control over how you smell, letting you manipulate others on a level that most would never notice and the rest might just think unusual. From the scent of roses to call up some passion in a romance, to that of freshly baked cookies to aid in relaxing others, you have figured out how to use those scents to alter their emotions, often convincing them to let their guard down or spark conflicts between others. This also allows you to pick up on pheromonal cues and scent based languages/markings, if you have some experience with them.

The more decisive and dramatic your victory, and the higher the perceived stakes for each of you, the stronger this lure’s effect.

The chokers also gain a communications and monitoring system, allowing you to track their locations and vitals and speak with them (and them with each other) remotely from any distance, even between different multiverses.

The first is "exactly how she appeared when the choker (bracelet, anklet) was first worn." Any changes made to this preset will instead output an otherwise-identical copy as a new preset. The second is a bimbofication package that sets the following values to 100%: hair volume and length, breasts, hips/ass, thighs, hair length and volume, lip thickness, and libido, along with a general airbrushing and various smaller tweaks dependent on the individual.

(All interns involved in the incident have been safely restored from backups.) This upgrade allows your symbiote hosts, including yourself, to melt into a semisolid amoeboid form for better infiltration, whether by flowing through vents, along a ceiling or wall, or hitching a ride on a person. Symbiote hosts obey conservation of mass in their slime forms and must remain contiguous. The form may be maintained indefinitely and they otherwise have full control over the form's shape, texture, and coloration. Symbiote hosts that have innate supernatural abilities of biological or genetic origin (ex. X-gene, Quirks, hereditary magic potential, alien racial abilities, etc.) retain them in their slime form. If they have enough room, they may revert to their original or symbiote forms at will, and may also assume a solid "armor" form around another similarly-sized being.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">By doing so, a symbiote host who comes into contact with a capture target can bind them on their own, without aid from a larva. The slime form flows under the target's clothes and equipment, fully encasing them and keeping them compliant with sexual stimulation while injecting symbiote transformative fluid into blood vessels close to the skin and pumping into the digestive or (for female targets) reproductive systems. In this state, the slime form can also mentally converse with the target and speak with their voice, use their slime body as natural weapons, etc., until the target is converted (captured and symbiote-bound). This conversion method obeys the same timeframe and interruption rules as a full-cocoon Shroud binding and may be hastened with all-the-way-through penetration. This will allow symbiote transformative fluid to be absorbed by every part of the target’s digestive system at once. After conversion, the two may separate to reveal the new capture's symbiote form with the same body growth as the other types of symbiote capture. &nbsp;Finally, a slime-form may overload their wearer's mind by spiking their libido and sensitivity. This also overloads their own mind, cannot be undone manually, and will only reverse itself when the duo are fully satisfied.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If more than one member of your symbiote hive has entered their slime form, they can combine into a larger slime with one body, two minds, and one will. Hive members may freely enter and exit such fusions without any negative side-effects. If any members of such a fusion have innate biological or genetic abilities, this will catalyze the appearance of those in the others.

You could give a target an article of clothing to wear while still retaining the power of your personal Shroud. If your Shroud is elemental, you may separate one portion of it without worrying about it dissolving. This can only be created from yourself or extant manifestations of your Shroud.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">These always retain the standard company protections on devices and may be recalled at any time.

Your Shroud has been upgraded to the elemental manifestation type! Choose one element for your personal Shroud from the list in the Additional Rules section. (Your retinues’ cloaks are not affected.) No longer purely physical, the Shroud is an elemental manifestation of your will, granting you a noticeable buff to your affinity with that element, as well as allowing you to generate and control significant amounts of it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This manifestation is always intense and obvious, such as a black void for Fearful Shrouds, burning flames or magma for a Volcanic Shroud, or a seemingly star-filled cosmos for the Void Shroud. As an extension of your will, it will only harm that which you wish it to harm. You may take control of a natural manifestation of your element by mixing in some of your Shroud into it. Manifestations of the element with a will of their own must be infused with your will the same way a waifu must. However, a willing manifestation may allow you to manipulate them, such as using a Cyber Shroud to repair a willing gynoid. Willful manifestations must either be bound like any other capture or released when you have no further need of their substance.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">These elemental shapes and tendrils have to be contiguous with you or each other. Portions of Shroud that lose contact begin to dissipate, generally within ten to thirty seconds. Your waifus, their Cloaks, and waifus in multiple bodies all count as “you” for the purposes of Shroud sustenance. As an example, you can create a ring with the Xeric Shroud that would quickly crumble into nothingness if it left your body, but it would not if one of your waifus wore it.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Your Shroud can only be damaged by things which could feasibly harm the element itself, such as water affecting the Volcanic Shroud while physical strikes cannot or gravitational effects damaging the Void Shroud. Even non-physical elements such as light and shadow are capable of becoming tangible, such as by becoming the physical cloak once more, though by doing so they can be damaged by physical forces.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Finally, you get the Body, Soul, and Psychic Talents for free.

It may now express either of these elements or themes, but only one at a time. True mergers of multiple elements are not possible, but practice will let you rapidly switch between them and keep the previous element’s manifestations active for longer afterwards. Doing so with directly-conflicting elements, such as the Volcanic and Boreal or Primal and Burial Shrouds, requires much more practice.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This expansion may be repurchased as many times as desired, until all listed Shrouds are acquired.

Their cloak now has elemental properties much like your own. Unless you deign to allow them an element you personally possess, one will be extrapolated from their current affinities and hypothetical developmental trajectories. Your waifus may have unique elements not found on the standard list, whether hybridized from standard elements or entirely new. If you buy this perk for a waifu when you purchase her, she will be shroud-bound before delivery.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In this way, your waifu will gain all the benefits like your own Elemental Shroud, that is, aesthetic harmonization for their constructs and cloak, an affinity for the element in other power systems, and the ability to generate and control said element. Unlike you, waifus may only have a single element. This increases the Shroud tier boost for your waifus to +3 for blue-stars, +2 for copper, and +1 for silver.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Once you’ve purchased this perk ten times, all new Shroud-bound waifus will automatically receive an Element without any further purchases. Additionally, all new purchased waifus will be shroud-bound before delivery; if you buy all ten purchases in your starting build, this will apply to all waifus purchased at that time as well.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.tyglphx820hm"><span>Shroud of Power: </span><span class="c12 c0">Grand Tapestry</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Expansion</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;100</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Requires:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Complementary Colors, Conjunction</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You and your Shroud-Bound waifus are now able to access each other’s elements through the sympathetic bond your Shroud represents. On a basic level, drawing on another’s Element allows you to generate and manipulate things within their purview as if the element was your own, complete with aesthetic palette swaps and altered material profiles as appropriate.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Affinities granted by someone else’s element, however, are capped by the intimacy - or at least, the intensity - of one’s relationship with them, which can complicate attempts to squeeze waifus for power. Conversely, maximizing social links through careful harem management (or blunt mind control) will allow even diametrically opposed and incompatible themes to be reconciled and harmonized with each other as one through the strength of shared affinities. Additionally, Shroud-bound waifus will benefit from the effects of all purchased Talents that do not otherwise apply to your waifus, whether you have Talent Sharing or not. (Take a full refund on all previous purchases of Talent Sharing.)</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Skill at manipulating constructs and phenomena is tracked separately and individually for each theme.

A Volcanic Shroud no longer needs to create flames, but instead be a temperature change; the Primal Shroud can create and manipulate bacteria and viruses, the Cyber Shroud can affect purely digital code, etc.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You gain an additional sense related to the element(s) of your Shroud within your aura, though reading and understanding it will take practice. The Cyber Shroud may let you access wifi and bluetooth devices, or you can feel spatial distortion with the Void. Additionally, you may infuse yourself with your element, increasing your strength, speed, and durability significantly.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">While the rules for contiguous manifestation are still in effect, the Shroud does not need to have the same intensity across the entirety of it. As long as you are able to understand how your element can be expressed in non-obvious ways in the air around you, such as changing a room’s humidity or brightness or creating slight spatial distortions, you will be able to manifest intense examples of your element in apparent midair around you.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">To reiterate, with an intense manifestation of your Shroud enveloping a target, no matter how hard they resist, binding them will generally take a minute, ten minutes, an hour, three hours, and twelve hours for a blue-star, copper-star, silver-star, gold-star, and T11 waifu respectively. Waifus within your ambient aura are still in contact with your Shroud and may still be bound by it, but the process will take much longer. If a waifu is exposed only to these milder effects, binding a member of each category will generally take hours, days, weeks, months, and years, respectively.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.fpx6rb216xxq"><span>Shroud of Power: </span><span class="c12 c0">Deep Weave</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Expansion</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;25</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Requires:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Elemental Loom</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Your Shroud is no longer merely an extension of your will, but part of your being. You are able to transform portions of yourself into your element(s) and heal or recharge yourself by absorbing manifestations of said element that you didn't create. If you had not already been capable of flight with your Shroud, you are now capable of such. Once again, controlling an elemental manifestation that has a will of its own involves usurping said will with your own like any other sapient target. Waifus absorbed in such a manner, such as a gynoid via the Cyber Shroud, or a normal human via the Primal Shroud, may be bound like anyone else, recreated and released from your service, or their form stolen as if you had Possessed or Substituted them. Manifestations whose forms were stolen may be sold to the company afterward like any other captured target.

This group mind operates on two levels: the higher, active, level allows everyone connected to participate in the telepathic equivalent of a chatroom, regardless of distance or barriers, such that you could even communicate between different multiverses. Your retinue members may actively share and experience each others’ senses through this network. The deeper, passive, level gives your waifus a full awareness of your activity and needs, such that they may even respond to orders that you haven't consciously given yet.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">This is only a group mind, not a hive mind. You and all your waifus retain your full individuality within the network and have no risk of forgetting whose life is whose. Any morality shifts that your waifus may develop are simply the result of close mental proximity to, and enforced empathy for, people with vastly different backgrounds and life experiences than their own.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have the Symbiote, higher-ranked hosts in the hive’s hierarchy will have more privilege in this network than lower-ranked hosts. As the person at the top of the hierarchy, you can demand access to the sensory feeds of anyone in the network and receive it without question. If you have the Shroud, your ability to read the minds of your waifus and access their senses is not so intuitive - at least not with this perk alone.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.w2rhcbomsztu"><span class="c12 c0">Apportation</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Perk</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;25</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Requires:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Tempest Runes 1 or Shroud of Power</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You and your waifus are now capable of teleporting yourselves, or anything in hand, to anyone else within your retinue as a whole with a few moments’ concentration. Doing this without some method of advance warning may be ill-advised. If you have Pocket Apartment or higher, you may teleport objects into appropriate spaces in the apartment instead of dropping directly in on someone else. If you have All Roads Lead To Home, you and your waifus may always teleport into the apartment instead of opening portals therein. If you do so personally and then try to open a portal out, you must still place the exit reasonably close to your previous outside-world location.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Teleporting something you have in hand does not require ownership, but certain conceptual limitations and the time required to initiate and complete the teleportation prevent this ability from being used as an attack or defense vector. You can’t strip your enemies of their Infinity+1 armor by grabbing hold of them, let alone telefragging people, nor shunt incoming bullets into a containment unit back at home.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">A person or item held by your or a retinue member’s telekinesis, Shroud, or insides (or some other method) may be teleported as if it’s literally in hand.

Most customers are only compelled to spend more and bring their friends when they come back, but a very different fate is in store for those you select as capture targets.

The building’s compulsion will make them agree; a skill download during the run-up time will more than compensate for any lack of experience or talent. As they do their task, they’ll be further transformed to match your chosen theme and become yours when they’re done.

General orders with indefinite durations can, eventually, be ignored, but a specific command with an instant duration will offer the Servant no chance to resist.

Delegate Masters' Command Seals are free and regenerate independently at the same rate as yours, but still count against your total and cannot be directly used by you. If you ever find yourself in an actual Holy Grail War, and all of your Command Seals are delegated, you will still have an inert set of Seals that may be used to summon, or contract with, a Servant locally.

It offers even more physical power than the first form, with a massive buff to your chosen affinity and all the other supernatural abilities you've acquired and trained.

Your mecha form can become large enough to wrestle Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann on an equal footing, and your dragon form can eventually swallow galaxies whole, but it’ll take you billions of years to get there.

Literally anything can be a conceptual element, provided you maintain a consistent theme, whether that’s Love, Time, Imagination, a season, Surprise, Heavy Metal, or even Infinity. The more esoteric and exploitable your chosen element, the more time you’ll need to develop and master its full potential. This time starts at tens of years for the basics and can stretch into the millions of years for the truly exotic ideas.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.ljxwb320hqx2"><span class="c12 c0">Dragon Aura</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Lure</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;200</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Requires:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Dragon Scale</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c7">You are a dragon.

Waifus who share a theme with your draconic element get one. &nbsp;When you flare your aura, one effective tier will be added to all waifus in the local universe for the duration, overriding the basic fear response.

A Tier 2 waifu will experience the same effects for the course of five doses, until she becomes Tier 3. Over the course of twenty-five doses, a Tier 3 waifu’s skills and fitness will become supernatural enough to qualify her for Tier 4, with the exact manifestation dependent on your element and her personality and themes.

Those whose tiers have been raised to Tier 7 by this perk will instead begin to manifest draconic traits, with the specifics dependent on your element and their personalities and themes. Waifus with pre-existing draconic, serpentine, or feline traits will experience this effect sooner. Costume animal parts are not enough to qualify a waifu for the transformative effect unless they’re worn for significant and ongoing timespans, while permanent augmentations (organic or otherwise) always do.

If you have Tempest Jewelry, you may reshape its pieces into any form desired, provided they retain the central gem and wrap around the target. You may benefit from the effects of the Tempest Jewelry on yourself as if you were wearing it, as well as any upgrades it possesses.

Your transformation involves manifesting your true form around your body via a blend of pure magical energy and ectoplasm, and the specifics of its shape are to your whim. You do not get an integrated weapon. Instead, choose an elemental affinity as per Dragon Heart. Your emotional intelligence is improved considerably, due to your ability to perceive dreams and astral space. If you have Ritual Circles, you may generate them via concentration, without the company app, and anywhere you can perceive, including upon or within yourself.

Your body may replicate any prior upgrades that have been integrated into it. You can swap out even all-encompassing upgrades within moments. Additionally, you can replicate any gifts, talents, or innate abilities that fall within the purview of your Transhuman type that your waifus - or anyone outside your retinue that you defeat in a confrontation - possess. The expression of these gifts is not necessarily consistent or exact.

If your current body becomes damaged, obsolete, or inconvenient, just switch to a new one. Members of high-risk professions, such as criminals or firewall sentinels, can be killed multiple times on a mission only to be brought back and sent into the field again and again. Your body is called a sleeve or morph, and the process of changing morphs is resleeving. Resleeving generally takes an hour, during which time both bodies are incapacitated. Only one active instance of your consciousness can exist at a time.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">At this stage, a potential morph requires a special anchor to designate it as such, called a core. At this stage you are only capable of utilizing the smallest type of core, a Least Core, which is roughly heart or baseball sized. When purely spherical, it generally ends up between 7 and 10 cm in diameter, though it may be any contiguous shape. Though the specific nature varies based on your Transhuman type and personal aesthetics, it is generally a hyper dense neural cluster for Biomorphs, a blackbox server for Cybermorphs, and a crystalline phylactery for Aethermorphs. Unless otherwise stated, a Least Core takes three months of dedicated work by you to create. Any active core may manifest your true form around or within it, depending on size constraints. Alternatively, the morph may be slowly transformed into your humanoid base or the true form via methods specific to your Transhuman type - generally retroviral elements, gray goo nanites, or raw magical ectoplasmic shaping, respectively.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Purchase of this perk provides knowledge as to how to rebuild your body, either via cloning, 5D molecular printing, or leyline restructuring. All of these processes create a body already in possession of an appropriate core, but are generally expensive and take six months to complete.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Given the combination of certain Bindings and Transhuman types, you may take over new bodies of local Waifu/Husbando candidates, turning them into new potential backup bodies. This process is identical to the Possession Origin, and the target is considered captured, though doing so neither grants or costs credits. New skills, traits, and abilities gained via this method are added to your true form as if you had Possessed the character. If you have the Primal, Cyber, or Burial Shrouds for the respective type, you are now capable of injecting targets with a portion of your Shroud. Unless somehow cured or purged, it will slowly develop into a new core within them. Treat this as the target being cocooned within your Shroud, but triple the time required for a capture. Without these Bindings, you are still capable of implanting a core into a potential waifu or husbando, but doing so entirely overwrites the original person with yourself and does not count as a Capture or Possession any more than raising such a target as a zombie would.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Your retinue is capable of hosting your cores, allowing them to act as relays for your awareness and purely mental abilities.

The core must be implanted somewhere along or within the central nervous system of the body it is within. Your psionic power can stretch the limits of biology, but it must be feasibly alive. The weight of your mind reduces the morph’s instincts when you’re not sleeved within it, with limited higher thought. They’re capable of breeding, sustaining themselves, and small talk, but not much else. Finally, regardless of your morph, you are able to maintain your individuality within another hivemind, and even suborn one with time.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have Alterzelu Symbiotes, your Queen is now able to spawn special, Royal, symbiote larvae. These larvae will cause your target to grow one of your Least Cores within themselves, but are otherwise identical to normal larvae. A Royal Symbiote’s egg takes two weeks to develop. The development of the Least Core takes place over the course of a month after the injection of the transformative fluid. Providing the new host with your fluids, such as by consumption, injection, or submersion, accelerates the process, reducing the time taken to just a week with sufficient amounts. An already-existing symbiote host may be given the royal transformative fluid directly, requiring applications over the course of a month.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Cybermorph: </span><span class="c1">A freshly made core takes an hour to properly imprint your quantum consciousness state onto it. However, with sufficient infrastructure and materials, you may mass produce the blackboxes without other input from yourself. You must backup and update your memories by joining the network they are on. Morphs must be mechanically or biologically feasible. Unsleeved morphs or hosts remain in a hibernative sleep state when not in use. Finally, regardless of your morph and given enough time, you are capable of freely entering and hacking any digital space to give yourself admin privileges.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have Tempest Jewelry, you are able to combine 32 separate pieces to create a special piece that must be at least the size of a helmet.

Any object may act as a receptacle for your phylactery, and you’ll maintain a pseudo-telekinetic control of it. Objects you possess are capable of movement when they otherwise wouldn’t be, such as a statue moving like a person. Morphs you are not actively possessing are reduced to simple automatons. A living phylactery, such as someone you have safely implanted a core into, retains much of their original personality and cognition, but moves through life like in a trance until directed otherwise by you. No amount of corporeal damage damages your true self, as you exist in astral space. Influencing the corporeal world directly from astral space is difficult. However, entities able to interact with astral space are capable of attacking and harming you there, and death in astral space results in true death regardless of how many phylacteries you possess. You may, upon purchase, change your elemental affinity as per Dragon Scale.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>If you possess Ritual Circles, you gain a special circle that can convert someone into a living phylactery.

This increases the effective tier bonus for blue and copper star waifus by another point, but is only an increase for Silver Star waifus if you provide more specialized and advanced things to upgrade their form with. If you have Evolutionary Engine Array, your waifus at this level or higher will benefit from it as well.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have Multicore Neural Leyline, you can apply the Essence Upload perk to a waifu for 20 Credits, plus the costs of First Augmentation and Full Conversion if she doesn’t already have them.

Lesser Cores and larger have an Essence Reactor at their center. Greater Cores and larger allow for additional Essence Reactors to be active at a time: 1 per Greater Core and 10 per Grand Core. If you possess an Elemental Shroud, anything within range of a Greater Core or larger is considered to be in light contact with your Shroud, even if you do not possess Elemental Loom.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Biomorph: </span><span class="c1">Larger cores are grown from Least Cores, and even morphs reduced to instincts may develop and grow into something resembling your true form should you wish. Lesser Cores or larger alleviate the stress of the Least Core on morphs within the larger core’s range. These morphs are not reduced to instincts, and act as part of a hive intelligence: what is ‘you’ is a conglomerate of the various intelligences. &nbsp;You are more like a corporation or nation unto yourself. As the overmind of this intelligence, only extreme circumstances would cause significant personality shifts due to new minds being brought in. You may accelerate the growth of a morph’s core by feeding it your loose (i.e. not in a morph of its own) smaller cores. We do not recommend growing a core larger than the morph it’s inside; the transition is quite painful. If you were not already capable of such, you may now communicate telepathically with things within range of an active core. You possess telekinetic abilities that scale with the number of cores within range. Finally, take the Science, Martial, and Creative Talents for free.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span>Medium Cores and larger will slowly infect their environment with an organic substrate called creep. Solid matter takes priority over liquids and gasses. Creep is not a solid mass; rooms and corridors will naturally form inside it and will not be blocked off by further expansion. Your and </span><span>your</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;retinue’s things are immune to this. Medium Cores spread creep at a rate of 1 cm (in an even radius around the core) every 5 minutes, up to a limit of 25 m. Greater Cores spread creep at a rate of 1 cm every 12 seconds, up to a limit of 1.25 km. Grand Cores spread creep at a rate of 2 cm every second, up to a limit of 62.5 km. Two cores linked by creep will add each others’ base spread rates and limits to their own. If part of a bed of creep is no longer within the limit of any active core’s range, that part of the bed will recede to the new boundary over the course of a week. Neutral and hostile sapient beings in contact with your creep will find their effective tiers reduced by 1, to a minimum of 1, according to the size of the largest core sustaining that bed: Medium, blue-star only; Greater, up to copper-star; Grand, up to silver-star.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have Alterzelu Symbiotes, you may now directly convert larvae into cores. Doing so takes half the time it normally takes to create a core. For every Greater Core you possess, you may have an additional Queen. Support Queens follow the same rules as your first Queen. When you produce your first Grand Core, select one of your existing Queens to become an Empress. You can only do this once, so make it count. Your Empress is capable of producing one Royal larva at a time in only four days and is ranked above all of the support Queens in your hive’ hierarchy - including your original Queen, if you chose another to be your Empress. If a support Queen qualifies for her own symbiote theme as per the regular rules, but your Empress has already imposed her own theme on the entire hive, the two themes will hybridize in a natural way, but only in the lesser queen and her subordinates.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Morphs hosting Medium Cores and larger may act as incubators for your Empress and Support Queens. Each active Medium Core increases the number of eggs your Empress will produce per reproductive cycle by a flat 10x multiplier: 1 every two days for the duration, 10, 20, 30, etc. Greater and Grand Cores count as 10 and 100 Medium Cores each for the purpose of all larva production. Each active Medium Core increases your </span><span>support Queens’</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;egg count per cycle by a flat 100%: 1 every cycle, 2, 3, etc. For regular larva production, your support Queens’ cycles are still two days long within a 28-day spawning period (14 cycles in a row); for Royal symbiote production, their cycles are stil 14 days long (one at a time). Each Grand Core counts as 10 Greater Cores for the purpose of your support queen cap.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Possession of a Greater Core or larger allows you to melt down and fuse larvae into various forms. You may functionally purchase items from the Catch-a-Ride catalog at a rate of 25 larvae per effective Credit. These vehicles may not have a cost higher than 50 Credits if you have at least one Greater Core or larger, or 100 Credits if you have at least one Grand Core or larger. &nbsp;These are biological entities that approximate the function of the vehicle. More exotic abilities such as time travel are only possible if you’ve encountered an example of such before. These only function within range of an active core.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you possess a Primal Shroud, you may convert biomass into a core at a 50:1 ratio. Additionally, all biomass within range of any core’s effect is considered to be in direct, sustained, contact with you. Finally, if you possess at least one Medium Core or larger, you may instead invest mass into creating vehicles the way that the Alterzelu Symbiote allows. Medium Cores can generate 1 effective credit per day, Greater Cores can generate 5, and Grand Cores can generate 25. Your credit cap per vehicle is based on your largest core: 25 for Medium, 75 for Greater, and 150 for Grand.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Cybermorph: </span><span class="c1">Larger cores are built from smaller ones, and even Least Cores may be networked together to replicate the effects of their greaters. Every 5 Least Core-equivalents networked together provide enough runtime to run the equivalent to two more instances of your consciousness. This runtime may be partitioned as desired from little more than a VI to hyper-intelligences worth multiple minds. Cores may be networked together, provided one is within range of another or they have direct line of sight. This means that in addition to creating a physical Greater Core, you may also create a temporary Greater Core when enough morphs come together. You may relay your intelligence through any electronic device you have hacked or interface with any technology within range of an active core. Take Mind Defense for free. You may also partition off runtime to create a digital world. The first instance dedicated to this creates an area of roughly 100 sq m, controllable as per Grand Manor. Every additional instance worth of runtime dedicated to this task doubles the available space.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have Tempest Jewelry, you may create special equipment from them that allows you to digitize physical items or bring them forth from the digital world. Once converted, they no longer count as Tempest Jewelry for the purposes of your stock or capture. Each piece allows for approximately 1 cubic meter of space to be affected at a time. Targets with a will of their own must be willing or unconscious to make the transfer. If you are not currently simulating a digital world, they are simply stored in memory until retrieved.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you possess a Cyber Shroud, you may digitize anything that your Shroud envelops, though digitizing targets with a will requires cooperation, unconsciousness, or suffusing them with your own will.

Anyone within your digital world is functionally cocooned by your Shroud.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Aethermorph: </span><span class="c1">Your original soul and consciousness has become an Oversoul. By sacrificing a core, you can create component souls or upgrade an existing one to a higher level. There is a soul-stage that corresponds to each stage of cores. Each component soul is an instance of your consciousness, capable of individuality but absolutely obedient and subordinate to the souls above it in the hierarchy. A soul may have seven component souls of a level below, possessing all of their skills and abilities, though this awareness is primarily unconscious.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The sacrifice of a Least Core creates a T1 Soul, which may, through training and effort, grow to at most a T2. A Lesser Core creates a T3 that may grow to T4. A Medium Core creates a T5 that may grow to T6. A Greater creates a T7 that may grow to T8, and a Grand creates a T9. While their power is reduced, component souls may grow on their own to certain limits. No soul may ever exceed the power of your Oversoul. At any time, any component of your soul may summon another or summon themselves to them.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You may change your Element a third time. Your component souls will possess smaller sections of your Element. For example, if your Element is Fire, a soul directly beneath your Oversoul might have an Element of Embers, and one of its souls may have an Element of Ashes. Subordinate souls’ elemental affinities stack with those of higher souls, much like a Dragon’s element will with a Shroud.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The weight of your soul may influence the souls of those nearby. Souls sleeved into a morph may influence those within range of its core whose Tier is lower than their own. The greater the difference in Tier, the greater the control. A T2 within range of a T2 component soul may feel a mild urge or itch to do as you desire without really knowing why, while an Extra in range of a T10 would be irresistibly compelled.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Finally, take the Psychic and Martial Talents for free.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have Ritual Circles, you gain the ability to use them to create places of power.

This otherwise works like creating a living phylactery.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have a Burial Shroud, you may replicate the above effect by infusing a portion of your soul into an object or place as if it were a potential waifu or husbando. Treat objects large enough to act as a Least or Lesser Core as blue-star waifus, objects or places that could act as Medium or Greater Cores as copper-stars, and locations that could act as Grand Cores as silver-stars for the purposes of conversion. Waifus and followers may also create cores and places of power via rituals that take 100 times longer than it would for you to do so yourself. Finally, any meaningful concentrations of your Element, within range of even an inactive core, count as intense contact with your Shroud. These include a target acting tyrannical when your element is Tyranny, or baking in the heat of a forge if your Element is Fire.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.celt1bds00xa"><span class="c12 c0">Incandescent Ascendancy Machine</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Self</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;200</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Requires:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Multicore Neural Leylines, Pocket Apartment</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Rudimentary creatures of form and flesh, simplistic souls of machine and magic, they touch your mind, fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding.

Are.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You have transcended the purely physical and are now a radiant being of energy and patterns and information. Your upper and lower bounds of consciousness have been expanded. You may now create a Master Core, which requires 100,000 cores worth of effort to create. A Master Core is about the size of a modern zeppelin (75 m) and has a range of 312,500,000 km (~104.45 AU). Each Master Core allows 100 additional Essence Reactors to be active at a time.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Biomorph: </span><span class="c1">You are purely psionic, anchored to the physical world by your genetic code. If a single example of your genetics continues to exist, so too shall your mind persist, though the amount of your consciousness and power that you can bring to bear is limited by the available biomass and neural tissue. All of your cores, even Least Cores, act as individual consciousnesses and relays for your true self, but you are able to guide even the smallest instances of your being even outside of that range. Fine control is limited while outside the range of a core; you can give them goals, but not control specific actions.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Possession of a Master Core removes the credit cap on vehicles created via Larvae or your Primal Shroud. Any morph with a Greater Core or higher may now freely draw and dismiss things within it to and from the Pocket Apartment. You may use this material to repair your true form. Master Cores spread creep at a rate of 50 cm every second, up to a limit of 3,125 km, and will reduce the effective tier of gold-star sapient beings by 1. Master Cores partially warp reality around themselves. Unless you allow otherwise, any entity within an area equal to the size of your Pocket Apartment (with upgrades) has its effective tier reduced by an additional 1, to a minimum of 1, stacking with the effects of creep. This affects even T11 targets.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have Alterzelu Symbiotes, a capture target who trespasses on your creep risks being encased by creep and pulled into the nearest Medium Core or larger with spare capacity in that network, where they will be pumped full of transformative fluid and captured like anyone else. Medium Cores can only hold one victim at a time, Greater Cores a few dozen, Grand Cores around a thousand, and Master Cores can hold tens of thousands. Your Medium and larger cores count as you for the purpose of confirming a symbiote capture. Each Master Core counts as 1000 Medium Cores for the purpose of larva production and 100 Greater Cores for the purpose of your support queen cap.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have a Primal Shroud, any instance of your genetic code, from a spore, to even cells not completely broken down in a creature’s digestive tract count as contact with your Shroud.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Cybermorph: </span><span class="c1">You are purely digital, a fractal code capable of existing on any technology. Even one instance of technology infected by your program is capable of recreating the entirety of your consciousness, though your mind is limited by available hardware. If it can run Doom, it can hold enough of you to count.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Your Pocket Apartment has become partially digital, acting as a bridge between your digital world and more physical ones. Even if you dedicate none of your runtime to it, your digital world is at least as large as your Pocket Apartment and benefits from any and all upgrades to such. You may alternatively dedicate runtime to accelerating time inside your digital realm relative to the outside world.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">If you have a Cyber Shroud, any interaction with technology which has a fragment of your code on it counts as contact with your Shroud.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Aethermorph: </span><span class="c1">You have become a living, thinking concept. Your Oversoul is merged with your Pocket Apartment, becoming the beginnings of a world-body, a Jouten. So long as one phylactery exists, even the destruction of all of your souls in the astral world will not truly kill you, for these items may act as a catalyst to rebuild your soul piece by piece. Your Jouten may act as an afterlife for your waifus and followers should you wish. Unless your waifus are upgraded into Aethermorphs like yourself, or you possess Warranty Plan, they remain dead.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">By sacrificing a Master Core, you are now capable of elevating yourself beyond the limits of an Oversoul, allowing you to make seven more Oversouls below you, seven direct component souls each for them (including any that you already had at that stage), and so on. You may change your Element a final time.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>If you have a Burial Shroud, any interaction with an intense example of your Element counts as contact with you, as your soul is one with every such instance of it. This includes things as simple as someone casting a spell if your element is Magic or being outside at night if your element is Stars. Sufficiently powerful divinities and other entities with authority over the same element may contest your control or even bar you access to their domains, shielding their followers from this effect.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.g2hyqxranj9a"><span class="c12 c0">Singularity</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Type:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Self</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;T11 Ticket</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Requires:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Incandescent Ascendancy Machine</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Surpassing limitations is the very nature of transhumanism.

You will neither be That Guy whom women warn their friends about, nor the otaku nerd whose obsessions drive others away. This does not lend any additional power to your words - that’s what Siren’s Song is for - nor will it make you enjoy social interactions for their own sake. It only guarantees knowledge and competence. You are also immediately fluent in any spoken language you encounter and will speak it like any native in only a few days, with mastery of the written form taking a week on average; this part always applies to your waifus as well.</span><span>&nbsp;With a trainer or opponent, you can elevate your skill beyond ordinary human ability, following the same rules as the other Talents.</span></p><h3 class="c11" id="h.5cch6f1r3qvv"><span class="c12 c0">Psychic Talent</span></h3><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Cost:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;20</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">You think.

This applies to traditional psychic abilities only: telepathy, telekinesis, remote viewing, astral projection, prescience, pyrokinesis, technopathy, etc., provided their trappings are neither magical nor technological.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Projections such as Stands or Personas are subject to this Talent, not Soul.

To rectify that, for a small fee you can opt to have your newly purchased waifus undergo a 24 hour training course, during which all the skills needed to properly operate, repair, and maintain all your purchased rides will be downloaded into their brains.

Portals will activate automatically when approached by a valid user: you, your waifus, and friendlies you invite, and deactivate automatically when not used. You and your waifus can sense the nearest portal’s location even without a map, and more precisely the closer you are to it. This is no replacement for a true map. Neutral, hostile, and uninvited eyes will not notice a portal’s presence, activation, or use, and cannot pass through.

After that, new worlds will slowly unlock according to the same rules as Exit Stage Left. You may also unlock new worlds by either traveling there yourself or capturing a waifu who’s been there personally. All purchased waifus, without the Yoink or Slightly Used perks, have only been to two worlds: your starting location and the factory where they were made. Don’t bother trying to go there.

This is the same control system as what Grand Manor provides. With this perk, your starting position will be within 30 minutes’ walk of the mansion, with a clear view of and path toward your destination so you don’t get lost.

This version even has some slight improvements over the original. First, the condition of the vehicle is now tied to da Vinci's own health. As long as she is in top condition, the Shadow Border will self-repair from any damage taken. This only works one way, so da Vinci can't be injured by attacking the Shadow Border. Second, it can Zero Sail through Imaginary Number Space and into other universes. Much like traveling to Lostbelts, however, you must establish a connection with something or someone in the target universe so you can anchor yourself to that location. In your case, captured and yoinked waifus count for their respective universes of origin. Finally, Zero-Sailing is now 100% nonlethal. It still has a tendency to... misfire somewhat at times, but you’ll always end up in a place where you needed to be, even if it isn’t where you wanted to go.

Familiars can be captured using local familiar-bonding methods, such as rituals or Pokéballs, or Binding-type or Other controls like anyone else, and are not subject to the romantic or sexual interest that your Bindings instill in your waifus or husbandos.

The app provides an easy pronunciation guide. With constant incantation, chanting cannot stop for more than one minute or the circle will fail and all progress lost. An activation incantation takes ten minutes, at which point the circle will remain active for 1.5x the Requirement for binding. Extended Duration increases the time the circle remains active to 15x the Requirement, but requires an activation chant of one-tenth the Requirement or one hour, whichever is shorter. Indefinite Duration further increases the time the circle remains active, with no further effect on chant length. With App Trigger, the circle may be remotely activated or deactivated via your company smart device.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Affected waifu tiers are mostly self-explanatory. By default, an activated circle is obvious to waifus in the intended tier or above. A basic circle, with 0 points invested in Tier, glows brightly while active, but with one point is just lines on the ground, but still feels magically active. With 2 points it's more subtle, so only silver-star waifus or higher can detect it. The higher the investment, the harder it is for the circle to be detected while active. "Special" indicates a circle that is undetectable while active even to T11 targets.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>Effect [duration] is only relevant for certain specialty circles.

This meter is invisible to you, the target, and everyone else. The higher their effective tier, the farther away from you they can be and still fill it and the faster it fills when they’re the same distance as a target with a lower effective tier. All lust meters are capped at 4 to the 13th power, or just over 67 million. Ignoring the effects of ventilation and physical exertion, if a target is just inside your aura’s range for their effective tier, their meter will tick upward at 1 unit per second. At this minimum rate, it will take just under 777 24-hour days to fill. Every ten times closer a target gets to you, their lust meter will tick up four times faster. If a target exits your aura’s radius, her lust meter will not recede, only stop increasing. This is, in theory, a smooth logarithmic curve, but authors are encouraged to simplify the process down to pure narrative for the sake of their sanity. The chart below lists each tier’s effective range.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.6fa52d4f52fd1c0ebb9ba69bb17750262365dad6"></a><a id="t.3"></a><table class="c2"><tbody><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Target’s effective Tier</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Your aura’s effective range</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">1-3</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">N/A (immune)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">4</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Extreme close contact (≤5cm)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">5</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Close contact (≤50cm)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">6</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same room (≤5m)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">7</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same building (≤50m)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">8</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same neighborhood (≤500m)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">9</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same city (≤5km)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">10</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same metropolis (≤50km)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">11</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same region (≤500km)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">12</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same continent (≤5,000km)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">13</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same planet (≤50,000km)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">14</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same orbit (≤500,000km)</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">15</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same star system</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">16</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same galaxy</span></p></td></tr><tr class="c28"><td class="c21" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">17</span></p></td><td class="c23" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c1">Same universe</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><a id="id.nw515dz5r75g"></a><h2 class="c22" id="h.2hlce5fqfv9t"><span class="c31 c19 c17">Setting-Specific</span></h2><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Ah!

Senogku Nadeko is the snake goddess version from Koimonogatari. Hanekawa Tsubasa has her stripey-hair makeover, can transform into Black Hanekawa at will, and can summon the tiger Kako as the Stand [Eye of the Tiger].

You and all purchased and captured waifus are aware of Tomoe's loops. Futaba Rio can spawn one clone of herself at a time and live both lives separately. Both Rios are equally real until one despawns. Toyohama Nodoka can swap minds and souls between bodies. Her time limit is 72 hours, unless she swaps herself, in which case the effect is indefinite until she cancels it. If you are part of the swap, and your original body takes fatal damage, you’re stuck until the body can be resurrected (or Warranty Plan brings back the other part of the swap) and the swap reversed. If the body you’re swapped into takes fatal damage, you will swap back just before death. Makinohara Shouko is the adult version from the movie. Her time travel method isn't particularly versatile, but it doesn't need technology.

If you have a Golden Shroud, you may reformat any of your Abyssal Exalts, including yourself, into Solars of the appropriate caste; the same applies in reverse to Solars if you have a </span><span>Burial</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Shroud. If you have both Shrouds, your Solar and Abyssal Exalts may choose whether to be Solar or Abyssal at any time, but only one or the other.

Anima’s human form can't use Pain or Oblivion, but knows all generic skills/spells from FFX by default. Her Aeon form is mobile, with no chains and a complete lower body. Her original lower half, "the Shadow," has its own complete lower body and lives in an explicit pocket universe. Oblivion feeds a target to the Shadow like normal. Anima may also temporarily switch places with her Shadow; this tends to result in extreme collateral damage.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c15 c0 c17">Final Fantasy - other:</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;White Mage has her 8-Bit Theater characterization. If you have a waifu from FFV, the four Crystals will spawn not too far out of your way, allowing you and your waifus access to the game’s job system. Lenna Tycoon has the wind drake Hiryu as a familiar; likewise for Krile from the same game and her own wind drake that has no canon name. If you have at least one waifu from FFVII and </span><span>Life’s a Beach or Grand Manor</span><span class="c7">, Mako Springs will appear in your Home and produce natural Materia at an accelerated rate. If you visit Spira or have at least one waifu from FFX, you and all of your retinue will gain Sphere </span><span>Grids; this may be one single shared grid, several grids shared by subsets of your retinue, or individual grids for everyone.

She instead has a strong affinity for shadow magic, capable of melting into shadows and teleporting through a world’s Twilight Realm, even if it doesn’t have one or she’s Bound by a Shroud of a different element.

Strictly speaking, the soul gem is only required for its functions as an item (e.g. transforming &amp; detransforming, detecting magic, etc), and she may operate and use her powers without it in a pinch - but her soul gem is as much a part of her magical girl regalia as her magical girl uniform or signature weapon, and she may always recreate it or recall it to herself at will as long as she's alive to do so. Finally, a meguca won't transform into a witch if her soul gem darkens completely (though she is still 'out of' magic while it remains in such a state), and she no longer needs an object such as a grief seed in order to purge that darkness from her gem. Just as using magic and falling into despair causes her soul gem to dim, true hope and other deeply felt positive emotions on her part may restore her soul gem's shine. </span><span class="c1">The magic pool in a meguca’s soul gem naturally recovers at a rate of one percent every minute, plus or minus the above effects of positive or negative emotions, respectively. If a gem darkens completely, its magic will not be usable, even if full, until the meguca deeply feels a positive emotion.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Magical Girls - Madoka Magicka (Characters):</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c7">If you already have both regular Madoka and regular Homura, the T11 Madokami purchase will apply as a </span><span>waifu</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;perk, upgrad</span><span>ing</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;the two into their divine versions with no changes to their personalities.

Milky Rose and Ace do not have time limits; Milky Rose, Beat, and Cosmos can switch between their human and alternate forms and remain in either indefinitely. If you don’t want to deal with a particular familiar, but it doubles as the Cure’s transformation device (such as Black/White’s or Bloom/Egret’s), they may instead be simple, non-living magitech.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Magical Girls - Revue Starlight:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;All the world’s a stage.
